          "answer": "For owner-operators with their own authority, trucking insurance typically costs $800-$1,500 per month ($9,000-$18,000 per year). Leased operators pay less.\n\nYour actual cost depends on years in business, driving record, equipment age and value, cargo type, and operating radius. Costs vary significantly by state — Ohio can be as low as $7,000/year while Illinois can run as high as $22,000/year for new authorities.\n\nNew authorities (first 2 years) are at the high end because fewer carriers will write the policy. After 2 years with clean history, rates typically drop 20-30%.",

          "question": "Why is trucking insurance so expensive for new authorities?",
          "answer": "New authority trucking insurance is expensive because only 3-4 carriers will write the policy — Progressive, Berkshire Hathaway, GEICO, and occasionally Artisan & Truckers. Limited competition means limited pricing pressure.\n\nThe carriers see new authorities as higher risk because there's no operating history to evaluate. After 2 years of clean operation, more carriers compete for your business and rates improve significantly.\n\nThis is why choosing the right agent matters more than shopping carriers for new authorities. The policy options are nearly identical — the difference is service, speed, and expertise with the FMCSA process.",

          "answer": "The cheapest trucking insurance for a single-truck owner-operator with their own authority starts around $7,000-$9,000/year for liability-only coverage in lower-cost states. Adding physical damage and cargo brings the total to $12,000-$20,000/year depending on location.\n\nTo get the lowest rate, you need: 2+ years operating authority with no claims, clean MVR (no violations in 3 years), newer equipment (under 10 years old), and no hazmat or specialized cargo.\n\nWarning: \"cheapest\" often means minimum coverage. If you're hauling $100K loads with only $100K cargo coverage, one claim wipes you out. Get adequate coverage, not just the cheapest.",

If you own it outright, it's optional — but one total loss without coverage means you're buying a new truck out of pocket.\n\nDeductible choice matters: a $2,500 deductible saves 15-25% on premium vs a $1,000 deductible.",

(2) Wait 20-21 days (FMCSA processing). (3) Around day 18-19, bind your insurance policy. (4) Your agent files BMC-91 (proof of insurance) with FMCSA. (5) Day 21: Authority goes active — you can legally haul.\n\nTiming matters: bind too early and you pay for days you can't operate. Bind too late and your authority activation is delayed.

Cargo insurance covers the FREIGHT you're hauling.\n\nAuto liability is required by FMCSA — minimum $750,000 for general freight. Pays when you're at fault in an accident and others are harmed. Cargo insurance is usually required by brokers/shippers — typically $100,000 coverage.

If you own the truck outright, it's optional but recommended for trucks worth more than $20,000.\n\nPhysical damage covers collision (you hit something or roll over) and comprehensive (theft, fire, vandalism, weather, hitting an animal).\n\nThe math: If your truck is worth $80,000 and physical damage costs $3,000/year, you're paying 3.75% of the truck's value for protection. One total loss without coverage means replacing an $80K truck out of pocket. If your truck is worth under $15,000, the premium-to-value ratio often doesn't make sense.",
