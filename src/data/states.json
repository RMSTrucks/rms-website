        "question": "How fast can I get a quote from RMS?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between Form E and a certificate of insurance?",
        "answer": "Form E is the official PUC filing - it goes directly from your insurer to the PA PUC as proof of coverage. A certificate of insurance (COI) is what you give to brokers and shippers. You need both for PA intrastate work. RMS handles the Form E filing and issues COIs in 5 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "I'm hauling out of the Port of Philadelphia. Any special requirements?",
        "answer": "Port work may require additional coverage depending on your cargo. Refrigerated loads have special weight permits (up to 107,500 lbs in the Philadelphia area). RMS knows PhilaPort operations and will make sure your coverage matches what the terminals and brokers require."
