faqItems:
  - question: "When are North Dakota's frost laws in effect?"
    answer: "North Dakota has the longest frost law season of any state in the northern plains, typically from early March through mid-June. NDDOT sets restrictions as weather and roadbed conditions require, and they are lifted when roadbeds stabilize for legal-weight traffic. Monitor via 511 or travel.dot.nd.gov."
  - question: "Can I run 105,500 lbs on North Dakota state highways?"
    answer: "Yes. North Dakota allows up to 105,500 lbs GVW on state highways (not interstates), significantly above the 80,000 lb interstate limit. This is a major operational advantage for route planning. Standard bridge formula and axle limits still apply."
  - question: "What do I need to know about trucking in the Bakken oil region?"
    answer: "Western North Dakota's Bakken oil region creates heavy truck traffic on US-2 and US-85. Infrastructure has improved since the initial boom but parking remains limited, fuel gaps of 40-60 miles exist, and hazmat crude oil transport faces heightened enforcement. Cell coverage has improved but gaps remain."
  - question: "Does North Dakota have toll roads?"
    answer: "No. North Dakota is completely toll-free with no weight-distance tax and no special highway fees. Standard IFTA fuel tax reporting applies."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for oversize/overweight permits in ND?"
    answer: "OS/OW permit insurance requires minimum $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 on the power unit -- significantly higher than the standard state minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000. Budget accordingly when planning oversized operations."
  - question: "How do I prepare for a prairie blizzard on I-94?"
    answer: "Prairie blizzards can drop visibility to zero within minutes. Keep your fuel tank full, carry winter survival gear (blankets, food, water, flashlight), monitor weather forecasts, and stop immediately when conditions deteriorate. There are no windbreaks on the open prairie, and drifting snow can strand vehicles for days."

North Dakota has two seasons that define trucking: the freeze and the thaw. The state runs the longest frost law season in the northern plains, from early March through mid-June, restricting axle weights on highways across the state as frozen roadbeds soften. When frost leaves the ground, highway pavement is at its most vulnerable, and the restrictions protect an investment in road infrastructure that this sparsely populated state cannot easily replace.

The Bakken oil region in western North Dakota creates a parallel trucking economy. Heavy oilfield service traffic moves on US-2 and US-85, infrastructure has improved since the initial boom but remains limited compared to major corridors, and crude oil transport faces heightened hazmat enforcement. Williston and Watford City anchor the region, with fuel gaps of 40 to 60 miles and cell coverage that has improved but still has gaps.

North Dakota allows up to 105,500 lbs GVW on state highways -- significantly above the 80,000 lb interstate limit -- giving route planners a meaningful weight advantage on non-interstate roads. The state is completely toll-free with no weight-distance tax, and oversize/overweight permits run $20 per trip through the NDHP E-Permits system. OS/OW permit insurance requires $100,000/$300,000/$50,000 on the power unit, well above the standard state minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000. Prairie winters bring temperatures to -40F with wind chill, and I-94 whiteouts can drop visibility to zero in minutes across the open, windbreak-free landscape. We recommend $1,000,000 CSL for any carrier running North Dakota, particularly those serving the Bakken where remote conditions and environmental liability compound the risk.
