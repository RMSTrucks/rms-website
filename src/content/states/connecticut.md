faqItems:
- question: What is Connecticut Highway Use Fee and do I have to pay it?
  answer: The Highway Use Fee is a per-mile tax for all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 lbs or more operating on any Connecticut highway. Rates range from $0.025/mile (26,000-28,000 lbs)
    to $0.175/mile (over 80,000 lbs). You must register with CT Department of Revenue Services before operating and file quarterly through the myconneCT portal -- even if you drove zero miles in CT that
    quarter.
- question: Can I drive a truck on the Merritt Parkway?
  answer: Absolutely not. The Merritt Parkway has a 7,500 lb GVW limit, an 8-foot height limit, and 40+ low-clearance historic overpasses. All trailers, tractor-trailers, rental trucks, and RVs are prohibited
    along the entire length. The Wilbur Cross Parkway has similar restrictions. Both run parallel to I-95 -- use I-95 instead.
- question: How much does the Highway Use Fee cost per trip through Connecticut?
  answer: An 80,000 lb truck driving 100 miles through CT pays approximately $17.50 in Highway Use Fee. A carrier crossing CT twice weekly at 100 miles each way at the maximum rate pays roughly $1,800 per
    year in HUF alone. The fee is reported and paid quarterly through the myconneCT portal.
- question: Where are the weigh stations in Connecticut?
  answer: 'CT has 6 fixed weigh stations: Greenwich (I-95 NB, WIM capable), Danbury (I-84 EB), Middletown (I-91 NB), Union (I-84 WB, WIM capable), and Waterford (I-95 NB and SB). CT also runs extensive
    mobile enforcement with portable scales at locations on I-84, I-91, I-95, and I-395.'
- question: When can I move oversize loads through Connecticut?
  answer: Standard oversize/overweight loads move daylight hours Monday through Friday only, with blackout periods during rush hours (6:30-9 AM and 4-6 PM). Loads over 13 foot 6 wide or 14 feet tall are
    restricted to Tuesday through Thursday, 9 AM to 4 PM only. Many CT bridges require capacity reviews for heavy or wide loads.
- question: Does Connecticut have toll roads?
  answer: No. Connecticut has no toll roads, bridges, or tunnels. However, the Highway Use Fee functions as an effective truck toll -- you pay per mile driven on any CT highway. E-ZPass is not needed within
    CT itself, but is critical for travel to neighboring New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.

Connecticut looks small on a map but packs three surprises that catch truckers off guard. The Highway Use Fee charges every truck 26,000 lbs or heavier a per-mile tax on any CT highway -- $0.025 to $0.175 per mile depending on weight, with quarterly filing required even for zero miles. The Merritt Parkway bans every commercial vehicle along its entire length, with 40+ low-clearance bridges that will trap any truck that tries. And I-95 through southwest CT between Greenwich and Bridgeport ranks among the worst congestion corridors in the country, routinely adding 30-60 minutes during rush hours.

CT insurance minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 are moderate compared to the region. The $25,000 property damage minimum is significantly higher than Pennsylvania $5,000 or Delaware $10,000. Connecticut is an at-fault state with required UM/UIM coverage. Vehicles carrying 8+ passengers face a $1,500,000 minimum liability requirement. Vehicles with GVWR over 18,000 lbs (intrastate) or 10,000 lbs (interstate) must report insurance annually to CT DMV. Federal minimums of $750,000 apply to all interstate for-hire carriers, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL -- I-95 congestion means higher collision frequency through the Bridgeport-Stamford corridor.

The state operates 6 fixed weigh stations plus extensive mobile enforcement. Greenwich on I-95 NB and Union on I-84 WB use WIM pre-screening. Portable scale teams patrol I-84, I-91, I-95, and I-395. PrePass and Drivewyze bypass services are expanding in CT. Truck parking is limited throughout the state, especially in southwest CT near the I-95 congestion zone -- service area spots fill early, with better options available on I-84 and I-91 corridors.
