faqItems:
- question: How much does it cost to drive a 5-axle truck through Delaware?
  answer: A 5-axle truck crossing Delaware on I-95 pays approximately $67.50 with E-ZPass -- $32.50 for the Delaware Turnpike and $35.00 for the Delaware Memorial Bridge (collected NJ-to-DE direction only).
    Without E-ZPass, the same crossing costs $80.00. Carriers running I-95 daily face $33,750+ per year in DE tolls alone.
- question: Are Delaware weight limits really higher than federal limits?
  answer: Yes, for state highways. Delaware allows 22,400 lbs on a single axle (vs federal 20,000), 40,000 lbs on a tandem axle (vs federal 34,000), and 65,000 lbs on a tridem axle. However, the Federal
    Bridge Formula still governs weights on the Interstate system, so these generous limits apply primarily to state and local roads.
- question: Do I need a Delaware DOT number?
  answer: Yes. All commercial motor vehicles with a GVWR over 10,001 lbs must obtain a Delaware DOT number. This is separate from your USDOT number and is required for operating within the state.
- question: How do I get to the Port of Wilmington?
  answer: 'From I-95 South: take I-495 South, Exit 2 (Terminal Ave/Port of Wilmington). From I-95 North: take I-495 North (right lanes), Exit 2. From the NJ Turnpike: cross the Delaware Memorial Bridge,
    take the first exit right (9A North), at the 5th traffic light turn right onto Terminal Avenue, which dead-ends at the port gate.'
- question: Is there an alternative to I-95 through Delaware?
  answer: US 13 runs from Wilmington south through Dover to the Maryland border and avoids I-95 tolls entirely. It adds significant time for through-traffic but works for deliveries in central or southern
    Delaware. For north-south through-traffic, there is no practical alternative to I-95.

Delaware has only 23 miles of I-95, but there is no good alternative for north-south traffic. The Delaware Memorial Bridge connects the NJ Turnpike to I-95 south. The Delaware Turnpike carries I-95 from the bridge to the Maryland border. A 5-axle truck transiting both toll facilities pays approximately $67.50 with E-ZPass -- $32.50 for the turnpike and $35.00 for the bridge. Without E-ZPass, that number climbs to $80.00. Carriers running this corridor daily face $33,750 or more per year in Delaware tolls alone.

State insurance minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 place Delaware in the moderate range, though the $10,000 property damage minimum is notably low. Delaware is a limited no-fault state with mandatory PIP coverage, creating a different insurance structure than at-fault neighbors Maryland and Pennsylvania. Comparative negligence applies in tort claims. Federal minimums of $750,000 override state minimums for all interstate for-hire carriers, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL regardless of operation type. The I-95 corridor is congested, and toll plaza stop-and-go patterns create consistent rear-end collision risk.

Delaware axle weight limits are notably generous: 22,400 lbs on a single axle (vs. federal 20,000), 40,000 lbs on a tandem (vs. federal 34,000), and 65,000 lbs on a tridem -- significantly above most states. These limits apply to state and local roads; the Federal Bridge Formula still governs the Interstate system. The Port of Wilmington at 1 Hausel Road offers full-service terminal operations including stevedoring, cold storage, warehousing, and logistics. Access from I-95 is through I-495 Exit 2. Delaware State Police Truck Enforcement operates with portable scales, and all CMVs over 10,001 lbs GVWR must carry a Delaware DOT number.
