faqItems:
- question: What are the 5 winter restriction tiers in Pennsylvania?
  answer: PA uses a 5-tier system that progressively restricts vehicles during winter storms. Tier 1 bans empty trailers, school buses, and motorcycles. Tier 2 adds loaded tandem trailers without chains.
    Tier 3 allows only loaded single trailers with chains or ATDs. Tier 4 bans ALL commercial vehicles. Tier 5 bans ALL vehicles except emergency. Speed drops to 45 mph during any tier.
- question: How much does it cost to drive the PA Turnpike in a 5-axle truck?
  answer: The PA Turnpike charges per-mile at $0.073 plus a $1.13 segment fee per interchange. A typical 5-axle toll runs $24.12 with E-ZPass or $48.24 with Toll By Plate. A full-length crossing from Philadelphia
    to Pittsburgh costs $100+ with E-ZPass. E-ZPass saves roughly 50% compared to Toll By Plate.
- question: What hazmat is banned in PA Turnpike tunnels?
  answer: The PA Turnpike tunnels completely prohibit hazmat Classes 1.1-1.6 (explosives), 2.3 (poison gas), 4.3 (dangerous when wet), 5.2 (organic peroxides), 6.1 (poison), and 7 (radioactive). Bulk quantities
    of Classes 2.1 (flammable gas), 3 (flammable liquids), 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 6, and 8 (corrosives) are also prohibited.
- question: Where are the weigh stations on I-81 in PA?
  answer: I-81 weigh stations use portable scales at rest areas. Key locations include Grantville (NB and SB, among the busiest in the state), Mountain Top (NB), Mahanoy (NB and SB), Chambersburg (NB),
    and Guilford (SB). PA uses portable scales extensively rather than permanent stationary facilities.
- question: Do I need PA PUC authority to operate intrastate?
  answer: Yes. Carriers operating for-hire within Pennsylvania must obtain PA Public Utility Commission authority. The filing fee is $100, processing takes 2-3 weeks, and you must submit Form E and Form
    H within 60 days of approval. Operating without authority carries a $1,000 per violation penalty.
- question: What is Christine's Law and does it affect truckers?
  answer: Christine's Law requires all drivers in Pennsylvania to remove snow and ice from their vehicles within 24 hours of a storm ending. For truckers, this means clearing the entire trailer roof, cab,
    and all surfaces. Failure to comply results in fines, and ice dislodging from a moving vehicle that causes injury carries additional penalties.
- question: Is I-81 or the PA Turnpike better for east-west freight?
  answer: I-81 runs north-south through PA (234 miles), not east-west. For east-west routes, I-80 (northern PA, no tolls) and I-76/PA Turnpike (central PA, expensive tolls) are the options. I-80 saves on
    tolls but adds time. The Turnpike is faster but costs $100+ for a full-length 5-axle crossing.
- question: Where can I find truck parking in Pennsylvania?
  answer: PA faces a truck parking crisis with roughly 500 fewer spaces than demand. PennDOT is adding 1,200+ spaces across the state, including 71 on I-79, 32 on I-80, and 40 on I-81. The 511PA app shows
    real-time availability. Private truck stops along I-81 and I-80 are the most reliable options, but fill up by early evening.

Pennsylvania is the Northeast's trucking gauntlet. The PA Turnpike runs 360 miles from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh through five tunnels, each banning most hazmat. I-81 carries freight 234 miles through eight counties and serves as the preferred I-95 bypass for long-haul carriers. I-80 crosses the northern tier 311 miles from Ohio to New Jersey. Each corridor has its own cost structure, weather exposure, and enforcement pattern.

The state's 5-tier winter restriction system is the most complex in the country. Tier 1 bans empty trailers. By Tier 4, every commercial vehicle is off the road. By Tier 5, nobody moves. Speed drops to 45 mph the moment any tier activates. Christine's Law adds a year-round obligation: clear snow and ice from your entire vehicle within 24 hours of a storm, or face fines when that ice sheet peels off at highway speed.

PA's state insurance minimums -- $15,000/$30,000/$5,000 -- are among the lowest in the nation, tied with New Jersey. Those numbers are deceptive. I-81 congestion near Scranton hits 80,000 vehicles per day, and the Turnpike's mountain grades through the Alleghenies create real rollover exposure. Federal minimums of $750,000 apply to any interstate for-hire carrier, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL regardless of operation type. The Turnpike alone can cost $100+ per crossing for a 5-axle truck -- make sure your insurance is not the corner you cut.

PennDOT runs one of the most active weigh station networks in the region. Only two permanent scales exist (Clarion County on I-80), but 14+ locations use portable scales at rest areas. PrePass covers 75+ bypass sites, one of the highest counts in the country. The truck parking crisis is real: 12,100 trucks competing for 11,600 spaces, with PennDOT adding 1,200+ new spots across I-79, I-80, and I-81.
