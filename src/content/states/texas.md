faqItems:
  - question: "Does E-ZPass work on Texas toll roads?"
    answer: "No. E-ZPass is not compatible with Texas toll systems. Get a TollTag, EZ TAG, or TxTag before running Texas. Without an electronic tag, you will pay double through ZipCash billing."
  - question: "What is the weight limit at the Port of Houston?"
    answer: "Standard GVW is 80,000 lbs. The Port of Houston Weight Corridor allows 93,000 lbs for 6-axle and 100,000 lbs for 7-axle trucks with a permit, within a 30-mile radius of the port."
  - question: "How do I avoid I-35 construction in Austin?"
    answer: "Take SH-130. It costs about 32 dollars for the full 41-mile bypass, has an 85 mph speed limit, and runs free-flowing 99 percent of the time. I-35 through Austin is free-flowing only 18 percent of the time."
  - question: "Is workers compensation required in Texas?"
    answer: "No. Texas is one of the few states where workers comp is not mandatory for employers, including trucking companies. Most carriers carry it anyway to protect against employee injury claims."
  - question: "What do I need for cross-border trucking at Laredo?"
    answer: "FAST enrollment through C-TPAT for expedited processing, customs bonds, a commercial invoice, packing list, and PARS/PAPS numbers. See our detailed border crossing guide for the full process."
  - question: "How many weigh stations does Texas have?"
    answer: "104 -- one of the highest counts in the nation. All commercial vehicles must stop at open stations unless enrolled in Drivewyze or PrePass bypass programs."
  - question: "What is the truck speed limit in Texas?"
    answer: "Same as cars. Texas eliminated the differential truck speed limit in 2011. Maximum posted speed is 85 mph on SH-130. Typical interstate speed is 75 mph rural and 60-65 mph urban."
  - question: "Do I need a separate Texas number to operate intrastate?"
    answer: "Yes. TxDMV requires a state registration number for CMVs over 26,000 lbs GVWR operating within Texas. Apply through the eLINC portal with registration options from 7 days to 2 years."

Texas is the largest trucking market in the United States by total miles driven, new carrier formations, and freight tonnage. Three distinct operating environments define the state: the Gulf Coast refinery corridor around Houston, the NAFTA trade lanes running I-35 from Laredo to Dallas, and the Permian Basin oilfield country along I-20 in West Texas. Each demands different insurance considerations, different route knowledge, and different levels of patience.

The numbers tell the story. I-10 runs 880 miles across Texas -- the longest interstate segment in any state. I-35 carries 6,000+ trucks per day across the Laredo border crossing alone. The state maintains 104 weigh stations and deploys over 775 enforcement personnel across CVE troopers, NAS-certified Highway Patrol, and civilian inspectors. Texas has an extensive toll road network in both DFW and Houston where E-ZPass does not work, meaning carriers need a Texas-specific tag before their first run or they will pay double. Workers compensation is not mandatory here -- one of the few states with that distinction.

**Current Construction Alerts:** The 4.5B I-35 Capital Express Central project in Austin is actively disruptive through 2028+. Tunnel boring machines arrive spring 2026. Check [DriveTexas.org](https://www.drivetexas.org) for real-time conditions. *(Live data coming soon.)*

Texas is also where weather bites without warning. The Panhandle gets ice storms and blizzards from November through March. I-35 between Hillsboro and Waco floods two to three times per year during spring storms -- budget four extra hours when storms are in the forecast. West Texas between Fort Stockton and Van Horn sees high wind warnings that will tip an empty trailer. Year-round operations are the norm everywhere else, but those three zones earn respect.

Insurance minimums in Texas run 30,000/60,000/25,000 for bodily injury and property damage -- higher BI than most states. Interstate for-hire carriers must carry the federal minimum of 750,000, and RMS recommends 1,000,000 CSL across the board. Texas juries hand down large verdicts. Between the I-35 border traffic, Houston refinery corridors, and Permian Basin oilfield operations, exposure is high everywhere you run. The state requires intrastate carriers to file Form E through the eLINC portal, and TxDMV monitors filings continuously -- a lapse triggers authority suspension.
