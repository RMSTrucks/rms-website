faqItems:
- question: Can I drive a truck on the Garden State Parkway?
  answer: 'No. The Garden State Parkway north of Exit 105 bans ALL commercial vehicles. Low-clearance bridges make it physically impossible even if the ban did not exist. South of Exit 105 trucks are permitted,
    but the Palisades Interstate Parkway bans commercial vehicles along its entire length. The rule in NJ: if a road says Parkway, assume trucks are banned.'
- question: Which NYC crossings allow tractor-trailers?
  answer: The George Washington Bridge allows all trucks (lower level preferred). Goethals Bridge, Bayonne Bridge, and Outerbridge Crossing all permit tractor-trailers. Lincoln Tunnel allows trucks but
    bans most hazmat and prohibits trucks in the center tube. Holland Tunnel bans ALL trucks over 3 axles -- only 2-axle and 3-axle single-unit vehicles permitted, with 12 foot 6 inch height limit and 8
    foot width limit.
- question: How much does it cost to drive a 5-axle truck across the NJ Turnpike?
  answer: A full-length NJ Turnpike crossing for a 5-axle truck costs approximately $55-60 with E-ZPass. Toll By Mail adds a 15-20% surcharge. Port Authority crossings (GWB, Lincoln Tunnel, etc.) cost an
    additional $34 peak / $28 off-peak with E-ZPass. Peak hours are weekdays 6-10 AM and 4-8 PM.
- question: What is the NJ Turnpike dual roadway system?
  answer: North of Exit 11 (Woodbridge), the NJ Turnpike splits into two separate roadways. The outer roadway (eastern lanes) carries trucks and all traffic. The inner roadway (western lanes) is cars only.
    Trucks MUST use the outer roadway in this section. South of Exit 11, all vehicles share a single roadway.
- question: How do I access Port Newark-Elizabeth?
  answer: Use NJ Turnpike Exit 14 for Port Newark or Exit 13A for APM Terminal/Elizabeth. Highway routes include I-95/NJ Turnpike, I-78, and designated port access roads. Gate access is at Calcutta Street
    and Tyler Street. The Doremus Avenue Overweight Route permits marine containerized cargo up to 128,000 lbs MGVW.
- question: What happens during a NJ winter storm travel ban?
  answer: NJDOT issues full commercial motor vehicle travel bans during significant winter storms. All tractor-trailers must pull into truck stops or designated areas immediately. Do NOT park on shoulders
    -- this results in towing and fines. Bans are announced through NJDOT alerts and 511NJ.
- question: Do I need separate permits to operate in New Jersey?
  answer: NJ does not require a separate state-level trucking authority or highway use tax like Connecticut or New Mexico. Standard federal authority (MC number, USDOT number) covers interstate operations.
    All vehicles must display owner name, municipality, and GVWR in letters at least 3 inches tall -- larger than most states require.

New Jersey is the most operationally complex small state in the Northeast. The Garden State Parkway bans all commercial vehicles north of Exit 105. The Holland Tunnel bans every truck over 3 axles. The NJ Turnpike splits into separate car and truck roadways north of Exit 11. Port Newark-Elizabeth runs a 128,000-pound overweight corridor on Doremus Avenue. Every fact matters here, because NJ punishes assumptions.

The NJ Turnpike is the backbone -- 122 miles from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to the George Washington Bridge. A full-length 5-axle crossing costs approximately $55-60 with E-ZPass. Add a Port Authority crossing to reach NYC and you are looking at another $28-34 depending on time of day. Peak-hour tolls hit weekdays 6-10 AM and 4-8 PM. Toll By Mail surcharges add 15-20% on top. E-ZPass is not optional for efficient NJ operations.

State insurance minimums sit at $15,000/$30,000/$5,000 -- tied with Pennsylvania for the lowest in the region. Those numbers are dangerously misleading. NJ traffic density, port operations, and multi-lane toll plaza merges create real collision exposure. Federal minimums of $750,000 apply to all interstate for-hire carriers, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for any operation touching New Jersey. The state choice no-fault system requires mandatory PIP and UM/UIM coverage, adding layers to your policy structure.

NJ operates 9 weigh stations with WIM technology for virtual screening. Carneys Point on I-295, Piscataway on I-287, and Bloomsbury/Stewartsville on I-78 are the ones you will encounter most. PrePass bypass sites are expanding, and Drivewyze software-based bypass is available at NJ inspection sites. Truck parking is critically limited in northern NJ -- Turnpike service areas fill up fast, especially near the port exits.
