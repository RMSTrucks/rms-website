faqItems:
  - question: "How bad is I-80 wind in Wyoming?"
    answer: "Genuinely dangerous. Gusts regularly exceed 60 mph, with 80+ mph not uncommon. Multi-day closures happen every winter. High-profile vehicles (empty trailers, box trucks under 40,000 GVW) get restricted before full closure. Check wyoroad.info before every winter trip."
  - question: "What is Wyoming's chain law?"
    answer: "Wyoming has two levels. Level 1 (Hazardous) requires chains, snow tires, or AWD. Level 2 (Extremely Hazardous) requires chains or AWD with M+S rated tires. Commercial vehicles need chains on at least two drive wheels at opposite ends of the same axle. Violation is $250, or $750 if it causes a highway closure."
  - question: "What is the height limit in Wyoming?"
    answer: "13 feet 6 inches -- lower than many states that allow 14 feet. Check before entering, especially with high loads. Loads over 17 feet require a front escort with a height-measuring device."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for Wyoming?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 federal minimum (we recommend $1M). Intrastate contract carriers need $750,000 CSL with Form E filed before authority is issued. Wyoming does not accept ACORD certificates -- Form E only."
  - question: "Is Wyoming operating authority permanent?"
    answer: "Yes. Once issued (same day with completed application and Form E insurance), Wyoming authority is permanent as long as insurance stays current. No annual renewal is required."
  - question: "What is the alternative to I-80 in winter?"
    answer: "I-90 through Sheridan runs at lower elevation with less wind exposure. If you are light or empty and I-80 conditions are deteriorating, seriously consider routing north through I-90 instead."
  - question: "Where should I stop on Wyoming I-80?"
    answer: "Key truck stops from west to east: Evanston, Little America (MP 68, large parking), Rock Springs, Rawlins, Laramie, and Cheyenne. During closures, parking fills fast. Stop immediately when a closure is announced."

I-80 through Wyoming earns its reputation between Rawlins and Rock Springs, where winter winds regularly exceed 60 mph and the crosswind profile of a 53-foot trailer becomes a physics problem. WYDOT closes this stretch 30 to 40 times per winter. The entire 402-mile corridor runs at 6,000 to 8,000 feet elevation across southern Wyoming, and the wind is often the bigger threat than snow. Clear sky does not mean safe. High-profile vehicle restrictions for trucks under 40,000 GVW kick in before full closure, and when closures hit, parking fills in minutes.

Wyoming operates a two-level chain law. Level 1 (Hazardous) allows chains, snow tires, or AWD. Level 2 (Extremely Hazardous) requires chains or AWD with M+S tires, and commercial vehicles must chain at least two drive wheels at opposite ends of the same axle. Unlike Colorado, Wyoming has no fixed "must carry" season, but carrying chains is essential common sense for any winter run. The state also enforces a 13-foot-6-inch height limit -- lower than most states' 14-foot standard, a detail that catches out-of-state drivers hauling tall loads.

There is good news. Wyoming operating authority is permanent once issued. No annual renewal, no re-filing, no re-application -- just keep your insurance current. Authority is issued same day when the application and Form E are submitted. Wyoming does not accept ACORD certificates, binders, or insurance ID cards for filing. Form E only. The state has no toll roads (the legislature specifically rejected an I-80 tolling proposal), no weight-distance tax, and 14 Ports of Entry where all commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs must stop when directed. For insurance, we recommend $1,000,000 CSL. I-80 wind incidents generate multi-vehicle pileups that make state minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$20,000 dangerously inadequate.
