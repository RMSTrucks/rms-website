faqItems:
  - question: "What are Iowa's trucking insurance minimums?"
    answer: "Iowa has the lowest minimums in the Midwest: $20,000 per person, $40,000 per accident, and $15,000 property damage for intrastate operations. Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum per FMCSA. These state minimums are dangerously low -- RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL."
  - question: "When are spring thaw restrictions in Iowa?"
    answer: "Spring thaw restrictions typically run March through May. Iowa DOT publishes an annual Spring Restriction Map showing affected roads and weight postings. Restrictions primarily affect secondary roads. Contact Iowa DOT at 515-237-3264 for current status."
  - question: "Where is the Iowa 80 Truck Stop?"
    answer: "Iowa 80 is at Exit 284 on I-80 in Walcott, Iowa, between Davenport and Iowa City. It is the world's largest truck stop with over 900 parking spaces, a full-service restaurant, truck wash, cinema, barber shop, and extensive repair facilities."
  - question: "Can I haul more weight with agricultural products in Iowa?"
    answer: "Yes. Iowa provides a 25% weight exception for trucks transporting raw agricultural products, allowing operation up to 25% over registration weight. In a state that moves massive volumes of grain, livestock, and ag chemicals, this exception matters."
  - question: "Are there toll roads in Iowa?"
    answer: "No. Iowa has no toll roads on any interstate or highway. All routes are free."
  - question: "Where are the weigh stations on I-80 in Iowa?"
    answer: "Key I-80 stations include Dallas (eastbound MP 115), Jasper (westbound MP 150.75) bracketing Des Moines, Cedar (westbound MP 268.5), and Avoca (westbound MP 44) in western Iowa. Drivewyze and PrePass are available at multiple locations."

Iowa is an I-80 and I-35 pass-through state with a strong agricultural freight economy and the world's largest truck stop sitting right on the main corridor. I-80 runs 306 miles from Council Bluffs (Omaha) to Davenport (Quad Cities). I-35 cuts north-south from Missouri through Des Moines to Minnesota. No toll roads anywhere. No chain law. A 70 mph uniform speed limit. Iowa is simple compared to Illinois or Ohio.

The Iowa 80 Truck Stop at Walcott (I-80 Exit 284) is the anchor of the corridor -- over 900 parking spaces, full services, and a landmark every long-haul driver knows. The Des Moines metro where I-80 and I-35 intersect sees the highest traffic volumes, and rest areas every 30 minutes along I-80 provide more than 2,300 truck parking spots between Des Moines and Davenport. Iowa participates in TPIMS for real-time parking data at select rest areas.

Spring thaw restrictions run March through May on secondary roads, and Iowa DOT publishes an annual restriction map. The 25% agricultural weight exception lets trucks hauling raw agricultural products operate up to 25% over registration weight -- in a state that moves enormous volumes of grain, livestock, and anhydrous ammonia, that exception matters. Harvest season (September through November) and spring planting create seasonal freight peaks.

Iowa has the lowest insurance minimums in the Midwest: $20,000/$40,000/$15,000 for intrastate operations. One serious accident would blow through those limits immediately. Interstate carriers need the standard $750,000 FMCSA minimum. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL regardless of operating radius. Iowa rates are low-to-moderate, driven by rural accident density and agricultural operations, with no toll costs eating into operating margins.
