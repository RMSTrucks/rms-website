    answer: "No. All express lanes in Georgia -- I-85, I-75, I-75 NWC, and the I-85 Extension -- prohibit vehicles with 3 or more axles or any vehicle towing a trailer. Georgia interstates are toll-free for trucks."

If you run the Southeast, you run through Georgia. Three interstates converge in Atlanta. The third-busiest container port in the country sits in Savannah. I-16 connects the two with some of the densest truck traffic per lane-mile in the region. Georgia is not a state you pass through -- it is the state that connects the entire Southeast freight network.

The Downtown Connector -- where I-75 and I-85 merge through central Atlanta -- is consistently one of the most congested highway segments in the United States. Every Georgia express lane on I-85, I-75, and their extensions bans trucks with 3 or more axles outright. Peach Pass is useless for commercial vehicles. The good news: Georgia interstates are completely toll-free for trucks. The I-285 perimeter loop is your bypass, and knowing when to take it is worth more than any shortcut app.

Georgia insurance enforcement has teeth. The GEICS electronic monitoring system detects coverage lapses in real time, which means letting a policy lapse even briefly can trigger enforcement action before you know it happened. Commercial vehicles over 10,001 lbs face a $100,000/$300,000 state liability minimum -- higher than the personal auto $25K/$50K/$25K but still far below what Atlanta metro exposure demands. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for any carrier running Georgia freight. Most shippers and brokers require it, and one incident on the Downtown Connector or at the Port of Savannah can blow through lower limits before the paperwork is filed.
