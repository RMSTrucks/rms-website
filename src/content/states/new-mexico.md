faqItems:
  - question: "What is New Mexico's weight-distance tax and how much will it cost me?"
    answer: "New Mexico charges a weight-distance tax of 11 to 43 mills per mile based on vehicle weight. Every commercial vehicle over 26,000 lbs pays it -- interstate and intrastate alike. A typical 80,000 lb truck crossing I-40 (374 miles) pays roughly $15-16 per crossing. You must register annually ($10 per truck) and file quarterly, even for quarters with zero New Mexico miles."
  - question: "Do I have to stop at every port of entry in New Mexico?"
    answer: "Yes. All commercial vehicles must stop at every operating port of entry for manifesting and clearance stickers. No exceptions. This is strictly enforced. New Mexico has six major ports: Raton (I-25), Gallup (I-40), San Jon (I-40), Anthony (I-10), Lordsburg (I-10), and Santa Teresa (Mexico border)."
  - question: "Is New Mexico really mountainous for trucking?"
    answer: "Much of New Mexico sits above 5,000 feet. Raton Pass on I-25 hits 7,834 feet with steep grades and severe winter weather November through April. The Continental Divide on I-40 reaches 7,275 feet. Tijeras Canyon east of Albuquerque runs through narrow terrain at 6,500 feet with winter ice storms. This is not flat desert driving."
  - question: "Can I pay a per-trip tax instead of registering each truck?"
    answer: "Yes. New Mexico offers a trip tax alternative for infrequent operators. Instead of annual registration and quarterly filing, you can pay per entry and exit. This is practical for carriers who cross New Mexico only a few times per year. For regular operators, the annual registration at $10 per truck is more cost-effective."
  - question: "Where are the cell coverage dead zones in New Mexico?"
    answer: "Every major corridor has gaps. I-40 between Tucumcari and Santa Rosa is very spotty. I-40 from Grants to Gallup is intermittent. I-25 between Raton and Las Vegas (NM) drops out frequently. I-10 from Deming to Lordsburg has minimal coverage. Download offline maps before entering New Mexico."
  - question: "What is the maximum weight allowed on New Mexico state roads?"
    answer: "New Mexico allows 86,400 lbs GVW on state roads -- 6,400 lbs above the 80,000 lb federal Interstate limit. Single axle limit is 21,600 lbs. For loads above these limits, single-trip overweight permits start at $25 plus mileage charges, with a maximum permitted GVW of 140,000 lbs."

New Mexico surprises truckers in two ways: the weight-distance tax and the elevation. The weight-distance tax hits every commercial vehicle over 26,000 lbs at 11 to 43 mills per mile. A loaded 80,000 lb truck crossing I-40's 374 miles pays roughly $15-16 -- not a fortune, but it adds up fast for regular operators, and the registration and quarterly filing requirements catch first-timers off guard. A carrier crossing New Mexico twice weekly on I-40 pays about $1,600 per year in weight-distance tax alone. There are no toll roads in New Mexico, but this tax functions as the de facto toll.

The elevation catches people who expect flat desert. Much of New Mexico sits above 5,000 feet. Raton Pass on I-25 at the Colorado border climbs to 7,834 feet with steep grades and switchbacks that produce severe winter conditions from November through April. The Continental Divide on I-40 between Grants and Gallup reaches 7,275 feet. Tijeras Canyon east of Albuquerque funnels I-40 through narrow terrain at 6,500 feet where ice storms shut down the state's busiest freight corridor. All commercial vehicles must stop at every operating port of entry for manifesting and clearance stickers -- no exceptions, strictly enforced.

New Mexico's state insurance minimums run $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 for BI/PD -- that $10,000 property damage floor is dangerously low, barely covering a fender bender. The state requires UM/UIM coverage that cannot be waived, unlike most states. For interstate carriers, the $750,000 federal minimum applies, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL. New Mexico's vast distances mean delayed emergency response, and mountain pass accidents at elevation produce higher severity outcomes. Cell coverage dead zones exist on every major corridor between cities -- download offline maps before you enter.
