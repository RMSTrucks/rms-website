faqItems:
- question: Can I drive a truck through the Baltimore tunnels?
  answer: It depends on your vehicle and cargo. Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) allows most trucks up to 14 foot 6 inches high and 11 feet wide, but bans propane over 10 lbs, bulk gasoline, flammable liquids,
    explosives, and radioactive materials. Harbor Tunnel (I-895) is more restrictive at 13 foot 6 inches high and 8 feet wide, prohibits all doubles, and bans the same hazmat classes.
- question: How do hazmat trucks get around Baltimore since the Key Bridge collapsed?
  answer: 'The I-695 western loop is now the ONLY legal hazmat route through the Baltimore metro area. The Key Bridge on I-695 east collapsed in March 2024 and will not be reconstructed until approximately
    2028. Before the collapse, hazmat carriers used the Key Bridge to bypass both tunnels. Now there is one route: I-695 west around Baltimore.'
- question: How much do Maryland tolls cost for a 5-axle truck?
  answer: 'MD has 5 toll facilities with different rates. JFK Memorial Highway (I-95 north): $48 Pay-By-Plate / $63 out-of-state E-ZPass. Baltimore tunnels: $24 PBP / $36 out-of-state E-ZPass. Bay Bridge:
    $24 PBP / $36 out-of-state E-ZPass. Nice/Middleton Bridge: $36 PBP / $51 out-of-state E-ZPass. A Maryland E-ZPass account pays significantly lower rates.'
- question: Do I need a Maryland E-ZPass or will my out-of-state E-ZPass work?
  answer: Your out-of-state E-ZPass works at all Maryland toll facilities, but you pay HIGHER rates than Maryland E-ZPass holders. If you run Maryland regularly, opening a Maryland E-ZPass account through
    DriveEzMD.com saves substantial money. A single I-95 transit through Baltimore can cost $70+ with an out-of-state transponder.
- question: How do I access the Port of Baltimore terminals?
  answer: Dundalk Marine Terminal is accessed via I-95 to I-695 to Broening Highway. Seagirt Marine Terminal at 2400 Broening Highway requires an RFID tag registered through eModal. Fairfield and Masonville
    terminals are accessed via I-895/Childs Street ramps with an E-ZPass discount of $2/axle. Each terminal has specific exit turn restrictions.
- question: Where are the weigh stations in Maryland?
  answer: Key locations include Perryville on I-95 SB (mile marker 93, PrePass equipped), West Friendship on I-70 WB (truck parking available), and Finzel on I-68 EB (12 truck parking spaces). MD weighs
    1.8 million trucks and inspects 95,000 vehicles annually -- one of the most active enforcement programs in the Northeast.
- question: What happens during a Maryland snow emergency?
  answer: When Maryland declares a snow emergency, trucks must have chains or snow tires on designated snow emergency routes. Emergency truck parking is available at designated commuter park-and-ride lots.
    Monitor MDSHA alerts for current status. Western MD along I-68 sees the most frequent snow emergencies.

Maryland trucking challenge is Baltimore. Two tunnels with different size limits, a collapsed bridge, a major port, and five toll facilities with three different pricing tiers. Get the routing wrong and you are stuck in a tunnel approach with a load you cannot take through, or paying $70+ in tolls when a Maryland E-ZPass would have cut that bill significantly.

The Fort McHenry Tunnel on I-95 fits most trucks at 14 foot 6 by 11 foot 0 but bans most hazmat -- propane, bulk gasoline, flammable liquids, explosives, and radioactive materials. The Harbor Tunnel on I-895 is tighter at 13 foot 6 by 8 foot 0 and prohibits all doubles. The Key Bridge on I-695 was the hazmat bypass around both tunnels until it collapsed in March 2024. Reconstruction runs through approximately 2028. Until then, hazmat carriers have exactly one legal path: the I-695 western loop around Baltimore.

State insurance minimums of $30,000/$60,000/$15,000 are notably higher than neighboring Pennsylvania ($15K/$30K/$5K) and New Jersey ($15K/$30K/$5K). Maryland is an at-fault tort state -- PIP is optional, but UM coverage is required. MD is not a UCR participating state, so carriers must register UCR separately. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL. Baltimore congested tunnel approaches, toll plaza stop-and-go patterns, and port operations create consistent liability exposure.

Maryland weighs 1.8 million trucks and inspects 95,000 vehicles annually. Perryville on I-95 SB at mile marker 93 is PrePass-equipped. West Friendship on I-70 WB offers truck parking. All vehicles with GVWR over 10,000 lbs must stop at open stations. Truck parking along I-95 and I-70 is critically short. South Mountain Welcome Center on I-70 near Frederick has 49 spaces plus 25 new ones, and designated park-and-ride lots serve as emergency snow parking during winter events.
