faqItems:
  - question: "Do I need PIP coverage for my commercial truck in Florida?"
    answer: "No. Commercial motor vehicles over 5,000 lbs GVW are exempt from Florida no-fault PIP requirement. This is a common point of confusion for carriers new to the state."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for port drayage in Florida?"
    answer: "1,000,000 liability minimum is the practical standard, plus cargo coverage. You will also need a TWIC card, which takes 8-12 weeks to process -- apply well before your first port run."
  - question: "How much are Florida toll roads for a 5-axle truck?"
    answer: "It varies by route. Alligator Alley costs 12.72 with SunPass and 15.90 cash. A multi-stop Florida run can cost 50-100 per day in tolls. Use the SunPass Toll Calculator for exact costs."
  - question: "Do I have to stop at Florida agricultural inspection stations?"
    answer: "If hauling agricultural products, yes -- every time, no bypass. Non-ag carriers can enroll in PrePass Ag or Drivewyze for bypass eligibility at agricultural stations."
  - question: "What is the truck speed limit in Florida?"
    answer: "Same as cars. Florida has no differential truck speed limit. Maximum is 70 mph rural interstate, 65 mph urban, and 55 mph in congested areas."
  - question: "Does E-ZPass work on Florida toll roads?"
    answer: "Yes. All Florida toll facilities now accept E-ZPass. However, do not run both E-ZPass and SunPass transponders simultaneously -- you will get double-charged."
  - question: "Where can I park my truck overnight in South Florida?"
    answer: "South Florida has a severe truck parking shortage. Truck stops fill by early afternoon. FDOT allows overnight parking at weigh stations when space permits. Use the Florida 511 app for real-time availability."
  - question: "What is the weight limit on Florida state roads vs interstates?"
    answer: "Both allow 80,000 lbs GVW. But state roads permit 40,000 lb tandem axle weights vs 34,000 on interstates. Agricultural and forestry loads get 44,000 lb tandem on state roads."

Florida is the third-largest trucking market in the United States by freight volume, and it never takes a day off. Three forces keep freight moving year-round: four major ports handling everything from automobiles to petroleum, a construction industry that never stops building, and a tourism economy that surges 15-20 percent during snowbird season from November through April. Unlike every northern state, Florida has no seasonal slowdown, no spring thaw weight restrictions, and no winter closures. That means 365 days of exposure -- which is exactly why insurance decisions here carry more weight than they do in states with a built-in off-season.

The regulatory landscape has a twist that catches new carriers off guard. Florida uses a GVW-tiered system for intrastate insurance minimums that is unlike any other state: 50,000 per occurrence for trucks between 26,001 and 35,000 lbs, 100,000 for 35,001 to 44,000 lbs, and 300,000 for vehicles over 44,001 lbs. Interstate carriers still need the federal 750,000 minimum, and RMS recommends 1,000,000 CSL regardless of weight class. Florida is a no-fault state for personal vehicles, but commercial trucks over 5,000 lbs are exempt from PIP -- a detail that confuses many operators new to the state.

Florida geography creates hazards that have nothing to do with ice. Alligator Alley on I-75 runs 80 miles with no services, a history of deadly fog events, and Florida panther crossings. I-4 between Tampa and Daytona Beach carries a reputation as one of America most dangerous highways, with theme park traffic around Orlando creating unpredictable congestion on weekends and holidays. Hurricane season from June through November can trigger emergency declarations that temporarily modify HOS rules and commandeer evacuation routes. And every border entry point has an agricultural inspection station -- if you are hauling produce, you stop every time.

Tolls are a significant operating cost in Florida. The Turnpike, Alligator Alley, I-4 Express, I-95 Express, and a web of expressways around Orlando and South Florida can add 50 to 100 dollars per day on a multi-stop run. SunPass PRO works across Florida and 23 E-ZPass states. All Florida toll roads now accept E-ZPass, but running both transponders simultaneously will trigger double charges. Express lanes on I-4 and I-95 require SunPass -- E-ZPass will not work in those lanes. Split regulatory authority between FDOT (weigh stations, permits) and FLHSMV (safety enforcement) means truckers interact with two agencies rather than one, and knowing which handles what saves time when you need answers.
