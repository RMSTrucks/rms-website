faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Idaho?"
    answer: "Interstate for-hire carriers need minimum $750,000 federal liability (we recommend $1M). Intrastate carriers can operate at state minimums ($25,000/$50,000/$15,000) but most brokers and shippers require $1M. File Form E for intrastate or BMC-91 for interstate authority."
  - question: "Does Idaho have chain laws?"
    answer: "Yes, but only on three specific mountain passes: Lookout Pass (I-90), Fourth of July Pass (I-90), and Lolo Pass (US-12). I-84 and I-15 do NOT have chain requirements. Chains are required on at least one tire each side of one drive axle when activated."
  - question: "What is Idaho's color-coded weight system?"
    answer: "Idaho classifies routes by color -- Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, and Black -- with different weight limits for overweight permits. Black/Interstate routes allow up to 105,500 lbs GVW. Some state highways permit up to 129,000 lbs with special permits through the Permits4Idaho portal."
  - question: "Are there toll roads in Idaho?"
    answer: "No. Idaho has zero toll roads and no mileage-based taxes. It is one of the simplest states for trucking costs -- no tolls, no weight-mile tax, standard IFTA fuel tax reporting."
  - question: "What is the truck speed limit in Idaho?"
    answer: "70 mph on rural interstates, 65 mph on urban interstates. Cars are posted at 80 mph, creating a 10 mph differential. Stay in the right lane -- you will be passed constantly."
  - question: "Where are Idaho's weigh stations?"
    answer: "Seven Ports of Entry: Huetter (I-90), Bonners Ferry (US-95), Lewiston (US-12/US-95), Lewiston Hill (US-95), East Boise (I-84), Marsing (ID-55), and Horseshoe Bend (US-93). PrePass and Drivewyze bypass are available with valid credentials and a clean safety record."
  - question: "How do I set up a new trucking company in Idaho?"
    answer: "Interstate authority requires a USDOT number, MC number, BOC-3, BMC-91 insurance filing, UCR, IFTA, and IRP. Intrastate authority requires a USDOT number through Idaho State Police (not FMCSA), Form E insurance filing, and vehicle registration with ITD. Contact Motor Carrier Services at 208-334-8611."

Idaho is deceptively simple. No toll roads. No mileage-based taxes. No complex urban routing nightmares. Boise is the only metro of any real size, and it barely registers compared to Portland or Seattle. Carriers based in the Pacific Northwest often set up in Idaho specifically for the lower operating costs.

But that simplicity masks real danger. The I-90 panhandle corridor crosses Lookout Pass at 4,711 feet and Fourth of July Pass at 3,173 feet -- the only two interstate passes in Idaho where chain laws activate. Over a recent five-year period, Lookout Pass recorded 101 crashes between October and March, with 47% involving commercial motor vehicles. On Fourth of July Pass, CMVs make up 19% of the traffic but account for 24% of crashes. These are not numbers that reward complacency.

Idaho's trucking infrastructure is straightforward and functional. The Idaho Transportation Department runs the Trucking Idaho portal for CDL services, the Permits4Idaho system for online oversize and overweight permits, and a 511 app with truck-specific settings for real-time road conditions. The state's unique [color-coded route system](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/permits-weight/) classifies highways from Yellow through Black, with weight allowances ranging from standard federal limits up to 129,000 lbs on designated state routes. No other state uses this system.

Three interstate corridors define Idaho trucking. [I-84 follows the Snake River](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/i84-corridor/) for 276 miles from the Oregon border to Utah, serving as the backbone for Pacific Northwest freight. I-90 cuts 74 miles across the northern panhandle between Washington and Montana -- short but [treacherous in winter](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/). I-15 runs 196 miles through eastern Idaho between Utah and Montana, carrying agricultural freight and connecting to the broader north-south network. Each corridor has distinct conditions, and planning your route through Idaho before your first trip is worth the 10 minutes it takes.
