faqItems:
  - question: "What should I do in a dust storm in Arizona?"
    answer: "Immediately slow down, check traffic around you, exit the highway if possible, pull completely off the paved roadway, turn OFF ALL LIGHTS (other drivers follow tail lights and will crash into you), keep seatbelt on, and wait for it to pass. Never drive through a dust storm."
  - question: "Can hazmat trucks use I-10 through Phoenix?"
    answer: "No. The I-10 Deck Tunnel (MP 144-146) prohibits all NRHM hazmat. You must route via I-17. This is the most common mistake out-of-state hazmat drivers make in Arizona."
  - question: "Is there a truck speed limit in Arizona?"
    answer: "No differential. Trucks follow the same posted speed as cars: 75 mph on rural interstates, 55-65 mph urban."
  - question: "What is the most dangerous corridor in Arizona?"
    answer: "I-17 from Phoenix to Flagstaff -- 5,800 ft elevation gain with steep grades and runaway truck ramps. I-10 between Phoenix and Tucson during monsoon season is the other high-risk corridor."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for Arizona trucking?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 federal minimum (we recommend $1M). Intrastate scales by weight from $300,000 to $750,000. Arizona Corporation Commission issues intrastate for-hire authority."
  - question: "How do I find truck parking in Arizona?"
    answer: "TPAS provides real-time data on I-10 at Ehrenberg, Bouse Wash, Texas Canyon, and San Simon rest areas. Available on az511.gov. Arizona is adding 846 new spaces at 10 locations."
  - question: "What do I need for the Nogales border crossing?"
    answer: "ALL commercial traffic enters through the Mariposa Port of Entry (not Grand Avenue). It has 8 commercial inspection lanes and handles over 4 billion lbs of produce annually. Connect via SR-189 from I-19."

Arizona trucking challenges are unlike anything else in the West. Instead of snow and chains, drivers contend with extreme heat that pushes pavement temperatures past 150 degrees, dust storms that reduce visibility to zero in seconds, and a dramatic 5,800-foot elevation gain on I-17 that transforms Sonoran desert into mountain pine forest in two hours. The threats here are invisible until they are not.

I-10 is the most-trafficked truck corridor, running 392 miles from the California border to New Mexico. Between Phoenix and Tucson, the Eloy-to-Picacho Peak stretch is Arizona prime [dust storm zone](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/heat-dust-safety/) -- the first corridor in America to deploy automated dust detection with 13 visibility sensors that reduce the speed limit from 75 to 35 mph when conditions deteriorate. The I-10 Deck Tunnel through downtown Phoenix bans all NRHM hazmat, forcing hazmat loads to route via I-17. Out-of-state drivers get caught by this restriction regularly.

[I-17 gains 5,800 feet](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/i17-corridor/) in 146 miles from Phoenix at 1,117 feet to Flagstaff at 7,000 feet. The Black Canyon descent southbound and the Camp Verde valley grades both have runaway truck ramps. Flagstaff at the top is an entirely different climate from Phoenix two hours south -- winter means snow, ice, and chain requirements. The [Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/border-trucking/) handles 45% of winter produce through 8 commercial lanes, making it one of the most important border crossings in the country.

Arizona has no differential truck speed limit -- trucks follow the same posted speed as cars at 75 mph on rural interstates. There are no toll roads. The TPAS system provides real-time truck parking data on I-10, and the state is adding 846 new truck parking spaces at 10 locations. Insurance costs are moderate, but dust storm multi-vehicle pileups and I-17 grade accidents generate high-severity claims that make $1M CSL the responsible minimum.
