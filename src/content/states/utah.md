faqItems:
  - question: "What is Utah's chain law and when is it enforced?"
    answer: "Utah uses a two-class chain law system. Class I requires vehicles over 12,000 GVW to be traction-device equipped. Class II requires all vehicles to have traction devices or 4WD. Commercial vehicles must chain at least 4 drive-wheel tires. Enforcement runs October 1 through April 30, though conditions can trigger it year-round. UDOT, UHP, or local law enforcement declare chain law status via road signs, variable message boards, and the UDOT Traffic app."
  - question: "Is Parley's Canyon dangerous for trucks?"
    answer: "Parley's Canyon on I-80 is the most frequently enforced chain law segment in Utah. Speed limits vary from 35 to 65 mph depending on conditions, and westbound trucks are limited to 40 mph. Ski season traffic between Salt Lake City and Park City adds significant congestion. Check the UDOT Traffic app before approaching."
  - question: "How long is the I-70 serviceless stretch across Utah?"
    answer: "The stretch from Salina to Green River on I-70 is over 100 miles with zero services -- no fuel, no food, no repair facilities. It is the longest such gap on any US Interstate. Fuel up at Salina (westbound) or Green River (eastbound). There is no help in between."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for trucking in Utah?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need a $750,000 federal minimum. Utah's state auto minimums are $25,000/$65,000/$15,000 -- the $65,000 per-accident BI is higher than the typical $50,000 in neighboring states. We recommend $1,000,000 CSL given Utah's mountain terrain and remote corridors where emergency response times are long."
  - question: "Can I get oversize/overweight permits at Utah Ports of Entry?"
    answer: "Yes. Three of Utah's six Ports of Entry issue permits on site: St. George (I-15), Echo (I-80), and Wendover (I-80). This is unusually convenient for loads entering the state. Overweight permits cover vehicles up to 125,000 lbs GVW. Contact UDOT Motor Carrier Division at (801) 965-4892."
  - question: "What are truck speed limits in Utah?"
    answer: "Trucks are limited to 75 mph on rural interstates and 65 mph in urban areas. Parley's Canyon on I-80 uses variable speed limits from 35 to 65 mph, with westbound trucks capped at 40 mph. Always check the variable speed signs -- they change with conditions."

Utah sits at the crossroads of three major interstates. I-80 runs east-west from Nevada through the Bonneville Salt Flats and Parley's Canyon to Wyoming. I-15 runs north-south from Arizona through the Wasatch Front to Idaho. I-70 cuts across central Utah's canyon country on what is the longest stretch of US Interstate without any services -- over 100 miles from Salina to Green River with zero fuel, food, or repair options. All three corridors converge in the Salt Lake City area, making Utah a connecting state where most truckers are passing through. That transit reality makes planning critical.

The mountains define Utah's insurance profile. Parley's Canyon on I-80 is the most frequently enforced chain law segment in the state, with variable speed limits dropping to 35 mph and westbound trucks restricted to 40 mph during ski season and winter storms. Utah runs a two-class chain law system: Class I covers vehicles over 12,000 GVW, Class II covers all vehicles. Commercial trucks must chain at least four drive-wheel tires when enforcement is active. Beyond Parley's, Soldier Summit on Highway 6 (7,477 feet) and Daniels Summit on US-40 (~8,000 feet) add more mountain exposure for operations outside the Interstate system.

Utah's insurance minimums carry a detail worth noting: the per-accident BI minimum is $65,000 -- higher than the $50,000 standard in most neighboring states. For interstate carriers, the $750,000 federal minimum applies, but RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL. Mountain chain law zones increase accident severity, and when something goes wrong on I-70 between Salina and Green River, emergency response can take well over an hour. Three of Utah's six Ports of Entry (St. George, Echo, Wendover) issue oversize/overweight permits on site -- an unusual convenience for entering loads that most states do not offer.
