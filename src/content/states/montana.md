faqItems:
  - question: "What is Montana's truck speed limit?"
    answer: "65 mph on rural interstates, while cars are allowed 80 mph. This 15 mph gap is the biggest truck-to-car speed differential in the United States. Stay in the right lane -- you will be passed constantly."
  - question: "Do I need to carry chains in Montana?"
    answer: "Yes. From October 1 through April 30, tractor-trailers with a GVW of 26,001 lbs or more must carry approved traction devices. Vehicles with 4WD are exempt from the carry requirement. Chains must be installed when conditions are posted or directed."
  - question: "What are Montana's major mountain passes?"
    answer: "Lookout Pass (I-90, 4,725 ft), Homestake Pass (I-90, 6,375 ft), MacDonald Pass (US-12, 6,320 ft), Marias Pass (US-2, 5,213 ft), Pipestone Pass (I-15, 6,418 ft), and Beartooth Pass (US-212, 10,947 ft, seasonal closure)."
  - question: "Is cell coverage reliable in Montana?"
    answer: "On major interstates near towns, generally yes. Off interstates, expect significant dead zones. The US-2 Hi-Line and eastern Montana have large gaps. Carry a satellite communicator for off-interstate travel."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for Montana trucking?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 federal minimum (we recommend $1M). Intrastate private carriers can operate at $25,000/$50,000 but this is dangerously low for mountain operations. Oil and gas carriers should budget for $1M or more with environmental coverage."
  - question: "Does Montana have toll roads?"
    answer: "No. Montana has zero toll roads and no mileage-based taxes. Standard IFTA fuel tax reporting applies."

Montana is big, remote, and demands self-reliance. The fourth-largest state by area with fewer than 1.2 million people, it enforces the biggest truck-to-car speed differential in the country: 65 mph for trucks versus 80 mph for cars on rural interstates. That 15 mph gap means trucks are constantly being passed, and the dynamic catches every out-of-state driver off guard. Montana's famous "reasonable and prudent" speed law -- once the only standard on the books -- is gone, replaced by numeric limits, but the spirit lives on in how Montanans drive.

Five major mountain passes define the trucking landscape. Lookout Pass on I-90 guards the Idaho border at 4,725 feet. Homestake Pass sits between Butte and Whitehall at 6,375 feet. MacDonald Pass on US-12 near Helena reaches 6,320 feet. Marias Pass on US-2 near Glacier National Park climbs to 5,213 feet through some of the most remote highway in the lower 48. Pipestone Pass on I-15 near Butte tops 6,418 feet. And the legendary Beartooth Pass on US-212 crests at 10,947 feet before closing for winter. From October 1 through April 30, tractor-trailers over 26,001 lbs must carry approved traction devices.

The remoteness is the other defining factor. The US-2 Hi-Line along the Canadian border has fuel gaps of 50 to 80 miles and significant cell coverage dead zones. Eastern Montana between Miles City and the North Dakota border serves the oil and gas sector with limited infrastructure. Emergency response times in these areas can stretch to hours. State minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$20,000 are dangerously inadequate for this reality. We recommend $1,000,000 CSL for any carrier running Montana, with environmental coverage for oil and gas operations.
