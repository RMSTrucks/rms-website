faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Missouri?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum liability per FMCSA. Missouri state minimums for intrastate are $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 split limits. Intrastate property-hazardous carriers need $1,000,000 minimum for vehicles over 10,000 lbs GVWR. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for all operations."
  - question: "Are there any toll roads in Missouri?"
    answer: "No. Missouri state law prohibits toll roads -- voters rejected tolling in 1970 and 1992. All interstates and highways are free. Note that I-44 becomes tolled when you cross into Oklahoma."
  - question: "What is the I-70 expansion project and when will it finish?"
    answer: "MoDOT is widening 200 miles of I-70 from Blue Springs (east of KC) to Wentzville (west of St. Louis) from four to six lanes. The project costs approximately $3 billion and construction runs through 2028 or later."
  - question: "Can I haul more weight on non-interstate roads in Missouri?"
    answer: "Yes. Missouri allows 22,000 lb single axle and 36,000 lb tandem axle weights on non-Interstate highways, compared to 20,000 lb single and 34,000 lb tandem on Interstates. The 80,000 lb GVW limit applies everywhere."
  - question: "How do I get Missouri intrastate operating authority?"
    answer: "Apply through the MoDOT Carrier Express (MCE) online portal. You need a USDOT number, insurance filing (Form E for liability), and vehicle markings showing your USDOT number plus MO on both sides of every CMV. Annual regulatory decals cost $10 per vehicle."
  - question: "Where are the weigh stations in Missouri?"
    answer: "Missouri has seven major stations: Barnhart (I-55), Caruthersville (I-155), Charleston (I-57), Eagleville (I-35), Foristell (I-70), Harrisonville (US-71), and Joplin (I-44). Vehicles 18,001 lbs and above must enter when stations are open."

Missouri is a crossroads state. Kansas City and St. Louis sit at opposite ends of I-70, and between them runs 251 miles of the busiest freight corridor in the heartland -- currently being expanded from four to six lanes in a $3 billion project that will reshape the drive through 2028 and beyond. I-44 angles from the Oklahoma border through Springfield to St. Louis. I-55 follows the Mississippi River from Illinois to Arkansas. I-35 drops south from Iowa to Kansas City. Every major freight route in the central US touches Missouri.

Missouri has no toll roads, and that is not an accident -- state law prohibits them. Voters rejected tolling in 1970 and again in 1992. Every interstate and highway is free. That is a real operating cost advantage, especially compared to the Kansas Turnpike to the west and Illinois tolls to the east. When I-44 crosses into Oklahoma, the toll booths appear. In Missouri, they do not.

Non-Interstate highways allow higher axle weights: 22,000 lb single and 36,000 lb tandem, compared to the standard 20,000/34,000 on Interstates. Height clearance runs 14 feet (up to 15 feet in commercial zones), which is more generous than most states. The truck parking situation on I-70 is severe -- all public rest areas and roughly 75% of truck stops hit capacity by early evening. Concordia, Boonville, and Wright City rest areas routinely fill after 6 PM.

Missouri is tort-based with no PIP requirement. Insurance rates run moderate, generally lower than Illinois and comparable to Indiana. The MoDOT Carrier Express portal handles intrastate authority applications, OSOW permits, and insurance filings online. Ice storms are the primary winter hazard, particularly on I-70 between Kansas City and Columbia and in the Ozarks along I-44.
