faqItems:
  - question: "What are Minnesota's frost laws and when do they take effect?"
    answer: "Frost laws restrict axle weights on state trunk highways and county roads during spring thaw, typically March through mid-May. Restrictions roll from south to north as the thaw progresses, with 5-ton, 7-ton, and 8-ton axle limits on affected roads. Check the MnDOT load limits website or call 1-800-723-6543 for current status."
  - question: "Are interstates affected by spring thaw weight restrictions?"
    answer: "Generally no. Interstates and major US highways are typically not restricted. The restrictions primarily affect state trunk highways, county roads, and some city streets. Plan routing to stay on interstates and US highways during thaw season."
  - question: "Does Minnesota have a chain law?"
    answer: "No. Minnesota has no mandatory chain law. Chains are permitted when conditions warrant, but studded tires are not allowed. Despite no chain requirement, winter conditions can be severe with temperatures reaching -30F and whiteout conditions on open prairie stretches."
  - question: "How do I check if spring weight restrictions are active on my route?"
    answer: "Check the MnDOT load limits website at dot.state.mn.us/loadlimits/, view the interactive restriction maps, or call the recording at 651-366-5400 or toll-free at 1-800-723-6543. Check daily during thaw season -- restrictions change as conditions evolve."
  - question: "What is the Motor Carrier of Property Certificate?"
    answer: "Required for intrastate for-hire carriers in Minnesota. It has 12-month validity and requires annual renewal. Apply through MnDOT with the required insurance filing."
  - question: "Why are studded tires banned in Minnesota?"
    answer: "Minnesota prohibits studded tires due to the road surface damage they cause. This applies year-round with no seasonal exception. Chains are allowed when conditions require them, but studs are never permitted on Minnesota roads."

Minnesota's defining trucking challenge is the spring thaw. From March through May, frost laws restrict axle weights on roads across the state as frozen ground releases its grip and gravel beneath the pavement becomes saturated. Road capacity drops dramatically, and restrictions roll from south to north as the thaw progresses. The limits -- 5-ton, 7-ton, and 8-ton per axle depending on the road -- can shut down county routes entirely for heavy loads. Interstates and major US highways generally stay open, but the last-mile problem is real: your shipper or receiver may sit on a restricted road.

Minnesota is a no-fault insurance state, which changes how claims are handled compared to tort states. State minimums sit at $30,000/$60,000/$10,000, with higher bodily injury limits than many plains states but notably low property damage coverage at $10,000. The no-fault structure means PIP-style benefits may apply to injuries, adding complexity that makes proper coverage essential. Interstate carriers carry $750,000 federal minimum, but we recommend $1,000,000 CSL given the combination of severe winter conditions, rural crash severity, and no-fault claims handling.

The corridor network runs through three interstates. I-94 crosses from Moorhead at the North Dakota border through St. Cloud and the Twin Cities to Wisconsin, with the western half exposed to open prairie whiteouts. I-90 traces the southern border from the South Dakota line through Worthington and Albert Lea. I-35 runs north-south from Iowa through the Twin Cities, splitting into I-35W and I-35E through the metro, then continuing to Duluth where steep grades and Lake Superior weather create their own challenges. There are no toll roads, no weight-distance taxes, and no mandatory chain law -- but winters routinely reach -30F, and the spring thaw hotline at 1-800-723-6543 becomes the most important number in your phone from March to May.
