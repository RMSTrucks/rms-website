faqItems:
  - question: "Why are there so few permanent weigh stations in Alabama?"
    answer: "Alabama relies on portable scales and roving ALEA Motor Carrier Safety Unit patrols instead of permanent stations. Only Heflin on I-20 operates as a traditional permanent weigh station. Officers can stop and weigh you anywhere on any highway in the state."
  - question: "Can I carry heavier loads on Alabama state roads?"
    answer: "Yes. Non-Interstate highways in Alabama allow 36,000 lb tandem axle weights and 42,000 lb tridem axle weights, compared to the standard 34,000 lb tandem limit on Interstates. This matters for local and regional hauling."
  - question: "Are Alabama interstates toll-free?"
    answer: "Yes. I-65, I-20, I-59, I-10, and I-85 are all toll-free. Alabama has four toll facilities (Beach Express, Emerald Mountain, Montgomery Expressway, Tuscaloosa Bypass) on secondary routes covered by the Alabama Freedom Pass."
  - question: "What is the construction situation in Birmingham?"
    answer: "The Malfunction Junction project (I-20/I-59/I-65 interchange in downtown Birmingham) is under reconstruction through 2028 or later. Expect lane shifts, reduced speeds, and significant delays during peak hours."
  - question: "Does Alabama have stricter hours-of-service rules?"
    answer: "For intrastate-only carriers, yes. Alabama allows 12 hours driving (vs 11 federal), a 15-hour on-duty window (vs 14 federal), and 70 hours in 7 days (vs 60/7 or 70/8 federal). Interstate carriers follow standard federal HOS rules."
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Alabama?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need a minimum of $750,000 in liability coverage per FMCSA requirements. Alabama state minimums for intrastate operations are $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 split limits. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for all commercial trucking operations."

Alabama handles about 250 million tons of freight annually, and most of it moves on two corridors: I-65 running 367 miles from the Tennessee border to the Port of Mobile, and I-10 crossing 66 miles of Gulf Coast between Mississippi and Florida. For through-traffic, Alabama is straightforward. For carriers who do not know about the portable scales, it is a surprise.

Alabama is the only state in the region that relies primarily on portable scales and roving patrols instead of permanent weigh stations. The ALEA Motor Carrier Safety Unit operates just one traditional permanent station -- Heflin on I-20 near the Georgia border. Everywhere else, officers with portable scales can pull you over and weigh you on any highway, any time. PrePass and Drivewyze coverage is limited because there is minimal permanent infrastructure to bypass.

The freight markets are growing. Huntsville and Decatur anchor a tech and defense corridor around Redstone Arsenal and the Mazda-Toyota plant. Birmingham remains a manufacturing and distribution hub despite the ongoing Malfunction Junction reconstruction (I-20/I-59/I-65 interchange, running through 2028 or later). Montgomery has the Hyundai plant. And the Port of Mobile is expanding container and chemical handling capacity, pulling more drayage traffic onto I-65 and I-10.

Alabama non-Interstate highways allow higher axle weights -- 36,000 lb tandem and 42,000 lb tridem versus the standard 34,000 lb Interstate tandem limit. The state is tort-based with no PIP requirement, no differential truck speed limit (70 mph everywhere), and no chain law. Insurance rates run among the lowest in the Southeast, though I-65 fatigue crashes south of Montgomery and Birmingham metro congestion create real liability exposure.
