faqItems:
  - question: "When do South Dakota's frost laws take effect?"
    answer: "Frost laws may begin any time after February 15 and continue through April 30. SDDOT monitors daily temperatures statewide and posts 6-ton, 7-ton, or 8-ton axle restrictions when conditions warrant. Restrictions are not implemented earlier than necessary and are removed when roadbeds stabilize. Check SD511 or the SDDOT website."
  - question: "What is the LCV weight allowance in South Dakota?"
    answer: "South Dakota allows Longer Combination Vehicles up to 129,000 lbs GVW with proper authorization -- significantly above the standard 80,000 lb limit. Standard bridge formula, 20,000 lb single axle, and 34,000 lb tandem axle limits still apply."
  - question: "Do I have to stop at weigh stations if my vehicle is over 10,000 lbs?"
    answer: "Yes. South Dakota requires all vehicles over 10,000 lbs GVW to stop at weigh stations -- including non-commercial vehicles. This threshold is lower than many states that begin at 26,000 lbs. Do not bypass."
  - question: "What is the tire weight formula in South Dakota?"
    answer: "South Dakota uses a unique per-tire-width formula: 600 lbs per inch of tire width for steering and dual-tired axles, and 500 lbs per inch for all other axles. This is a gotcha for drivers from states without per-tire-width weight limits."
  - question: "Does South Dakota have toll roads?"
    answer: "No. South Dakota is completely toll-free with no weight-distance tax and no state income tax. This combination makes it one of the most cost-efficient states for trucking operations."
  - question: "Is South Dakota a good state for owner-operator domicile?"
    answer: "South Dakota has no state income tax, which makes it attractive for owner-operators considering domicile options. Research current LLC and business formation requirements and consult with a tax professional for your specific situation."

South Dakota sits on the I-90 transcontinental corridor, the primary east-west route between Minneapolis and the Mountain West. The state transitions from flat prairie in the east to Black Hills terrain in the west -- a shift truckers feel as grades appear after 300 miles of open plain. The Chamberlain area at the Missouri River crossing marks the midpoint, and between Mitchell and Rapid City stretches a long segment with limited services that demands fuel planning.

Frost laws may begin after February 15 and run through April 30, restricting axle weights to 6, 7, or 8 tons on affected roads. The season starts earlier than Minnesota's and ends sooner, reflecting South Dakota's position slightly south on the thaw progression. SDDOT monitors daily temperatures statewide and posts restrictions only when conditions warrant. The state also enforces a 10,000 lb weigh station stop threshold -- lower than most states' 26,000 lb requirement -- catching lighter commercial and non-commercial vehicles that would bypass scales elsewhere. South Dakota's unique tire weight formula, calculating 500 to 600 lbs per inch of tire width depending on axle type, is another detail that surprises out-of-state drivers.

The operational advantages are real. Longer Combination Vehicles can run up to 129,000 lbs GVW with proper authorization. There are no toll roads, no weight-distance tax, and no state income tax -- a combination that makes South Dakota one of the most cost-efficient states for trucking. State insurance minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 apply to intrastate operations, with $750,000 federal minimum for interstate carriers. We recommend $1,000,000 CSL given the I-90 speed environment (cars at 80 mph), long distances between medical facilities, and winter prairie conditions that amplify accident severity.
