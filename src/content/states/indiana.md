faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Indiana?"
    answer: "Indiana intrastate minimums are $25,000/$50,000 bodily injury and $25,000 property damage. For-hire carriers with GVW over 10,001 lbs need $750,000. Interstate carriers must meet the federal minimum of $750,000 for general freight, $1M for oil/petroleum, and $5M for hazmat. RMS recommends $1M CSL."
  - question: "How much are Indiana Toll Road tolls for a semi?"
    answer: "A Class 5 (5-axle) truck pays approximately $87.49 with E-ZPass for the full 157-mile trip. Rates adjust annually on July 1. E-ZPass and I-PASS are both accepted."
  - question: "Why does Indiana have a lower speed limit for trucks?"
    answer: "Indiana enforces a 5 mph truck speed split: trucks over 26,000 lbs are limited to 65 mph on rural interstates while cars get 70 mph. Indiana is one of only 8 states with this differential. Indiana State Police actively enforce it."
  - question: "Do pickup trucks with trailers have to stop at Indiana weigh stations?"
    answer: "Yes. Indiana has one of the broadest weigh station requirements in the Midwest -- ALL trucks must enter open weigh stations, including pickup trucks with trailers and rental trucks."
  - question: "What is Indiana doing about the truck parking shortage?"
    answer: "Indiana has only 1 truck parking spot for every 11 semis. INDOT has committed $600 million over 10 years to add 1,200+ new spaces, doubling state capacity. Recent completions include 150 spaces at I-65 Lebanon and 128 spaces at the I-70 Clear Creek Welcome Center."
  - question: "Are there overweight permits for steel and agriculture in Indiana?"
    answer: "Yes. Indiana offers commodity-specific OSOW permits. Steel and aluminum loads can reach 120,000 lbs GVW, and agricultural loads can reach 97,000 lbs GVW. Single-trip permits start at approximately $20."
  - question: "What makes Indianapolis such a major freight hub?"
    answer: "Indianapolis sits at the intersection of I-65, I-70, I-74, I-69, and I-80/90. 75 percent of the US and Canadian population is reachable within 2 days, and 110 million people live within a single day drive. Indiana moves 724 million tons of freight annually."

Indiana calls itself the Crossroads of America, and the freight numbers back it up. Five major interstates -- I-65, I-70, I-74, I-69, and I-80/90 -- intersect here, making the state the number-one pass-through in the country for interstate highways. Indiana moves 724 million tons of freight annually (5th busiest nationally), and that volume is projected to increase 60 percent by 2040. From Indianapolis, 75 percent of the US and Canadian population is reachable within two days, and 110 million people live within a single day's drive. That kind of positioning makes Indiana a distribution hub without equal in the Midwest.

The operational reality is not all smooth pavement. Indiana enforces a 5 mph truck speed split -- trucks over 26,000 lbs are capped at 65 mph on rural interstates while cars get 70. Indiana State Police enforce the differential actively, and it applies statewide. Weigh stations are even stricter: ALL trucks must enter when stations are open, including pickup trucks with trailers and rental trucks. That is one of the broadest requirements in the Midwest, and it catches a lot of drivers who are used to weight thresholds in other states.

The truck parking crisis is real. Indiana has just 1 spot for every 11 semis, and drivers routinely park illegally on interstate ramps -- dangerous and costly if caught. INDOT has committed $600 million over 10 years to add 1,200+ new spaces and double state capacity. Recent completions include 150 new spaces at I-65 Lebanon and 128 spaces at the I-70 Clear Creek Welcome Center. The northern corridor brings its own challenges: lake-effect snow from Lake Michigan hammers I-80/90, and the Indiana Toll Road runs $87.49 for a 5-axle E-ZPass full crossing -- the most expensive toll road per mile in the region.
