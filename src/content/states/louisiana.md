faqItems:
  - question: "Why is trucking insurance more expensive in Louisiana?"
    answer: "Louisiana Napoleonic Code legal system creates a unique litigation environment. Pure comparative fault, short prescriptive periods, and historically plaintiff-friendly courts have driven rates up. The 2024 Direct Action reform should help over time."
  - question: "Does E-ZPass work in Louisiana?"
    answer: "No. Louisiana uses GeauxPass, a barcode-sticker system. E-ZPass, TollTag, and all other transponders are incompatible. Get a GeauxPass before regular operations."
  - question: "What is the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge?"
    answer: "At 18.2 miles, it is the longest bridge on the Interstate system. No stopping, no shoulders for most of it, and fog makes it deadly. Check 511la.org before crossing."
  - question: "Do I need a GeauxPass for the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway?"
    answer: "Yes, or pay cash. The 5-axle rate is $17.00 with tag, $18.00 cash. The Causeway has vehicle dimension restrictions."
  - question: "What changed with Louisiana Direct Action Statute in 2024?"
    answer: "Act 275 severely restricted plaintiffs ability to sue insurance companies directly. Insurer names can no longer be disclosed to juries. This is a major improvement for carriers, though legal challenges are ongoing."
  - question: "Can I bypass New Orleans with my truck?"
    answer: "Yes. Use I-12 between Baton Rouge and Slidell to skip New Orleans entirely. This is the recommended route for through traffic not delivering to NOLA."
  - question: "What special permits do I need for Port Fourchon?"
    answer: "Port Fourchon is accessed only via LA-1, a two-lane road prone to flooding. No special state permit, but plan for traffic delays and limited bypass options. TWIC may be required for certain terminal access."

Louisiana plays by different rules. Literally. It is the only state in the US based on civil law -- the Napoleonic Code -- rather than English common law. This is not a historical curiosity. It changes how lawsuits work, how liability is assigned, and how insurance claims play out. If you haul freight through Louisiana without understanding this, you are carrying risk you cannot see.

The 2024 Direct Action Statute reform was the biggest change to Louisiana trucking liability in decades. Act 275, effective August 1, 2024, severely restricted plaintiffs from suing insurance companies directly and barred insurer names from being disclosed to juries. This should ease the litigation pressure that has made Louisiana one of the most expensive states for commercial auto insurance. But legal challenges are ongoing, and carriers should not expect immediate rate relief.

I-10 is Louisiana lifeline: 274 miles east-west through petrochemical country, crossing the 18.2-mile Atchafalaya Basin Bridge -- the longest on the Interstate system. That bridge has no stopping, no shoulders for most of its length, and fog has caused fatal multi-vehicle pileups more than once. Four major ports drive freight volume: New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lake Charles, and Port Fourchon, which serves offshore oil and gas operations through a single two-lane road prone to flooding. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL at minimum for Louisiana operations. The state personal auto minimums are $15K/$30K/$25K -- the lowest bodily injury per-person minimum in this entire region -- and Louisiana litigation history means exposure here is higher than in neighboring states even with the 2024 reforms.
