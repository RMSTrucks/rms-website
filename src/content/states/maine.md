faqItems:
  - question: "Can I really haul 100,000 lbs on Maine Interstates without a permit?"
    answer: "Yes. Maine allows 100,000 lbs on all Interstate highways with a 6-axle configuration (minimum 3-axle tractor plus tri-axle semitrailer). This is authorized under federal law (23 USC Section 127(a)(11)) -- it is not a loophole. No special permit is needed for properly registered combinations up to 100,000 lbs. Loads over 100,000 lbs (up to 130,000+ lbs) require special permits and route approval."
  - question: "Why are Maine's insurance minimums so much higher than other states?"
    answer: "Maine's state liability minimums are $50,000/$100,000/$25,000 for BI/PD -- the highest of any state in our 41-state coverage area. Compare that to Pennsylvania at $15,000/$30,000/$5,000 or New Jersey at $15,000/$30,000/$5,000. Maine also requires UM, UIM, and MedPay coverages. The legislature set higher minimums due to the state's rural nature, long distances between hospitals, and the severity of crashes on rural highways."
  - question: "How much does the Maine Turnpike cost for a 5-axle truck?"
    answer: "A full-length run on the Maine Turnpike (York to Augusta, 109 miles) costs approximately $32 cash or $16-20 with E-ZPass. E-ZPass discounts can reach 50%. Volume discounts are available: 20% off for 30-39 trips per month and 40% off for 40 or more trips per month. I-95 north of Augusta to Houlton and the Canadian border is completely free."
  - question: "What are Maine's spring frost law restrictions?"
    answer: "From March through May, Maine reduces weight limits by 10-25% on secondary and posted roads during the spring thaw. Plan loads accordingly -- a 100,000 lb Interstate load may need to stay on the Interstate if your delivery point requires secondary road access during frost law season. Conversely, winter frozen ground conditions allow an additional ~10% weight tolerance for bulk commodities."
  - question: "Is I-95 north of Augusta really free?"
    answer: "Yes. The Maine Turnpike runs from Kittery to Augusta (109 miles) and is tolled. I-95 north of Augusta continues 222 miles to Houlton near the Canadian border with zero tolls. That northern stretch is also increasingly remote -- services thin out significantly north of Bangor."
  - question: "How do I plan fuel stops for northern Maine runs?"
    answer: "North of Bangor, distances between truck-friendly fuel stops become extreme. Aroostook County in January has very few options. Fuel up in Bangor before heading north. Plan overnight stops in Bangor or south where truck parking is adequate at Maine Turnpike service plazas. Running out of fuel in northern Maine during winter is a genuine survival situation, not just an inconvenience."

Maine allows 100,000 lbs on all Interstate highways with a 6-axle configuration -- no special permit needed. Authorized under federal law (23 USC Section 127(a)(11)), this is one of only two states (Vermont allows 99,000 lbs) where you can legally exceed the 80,000 lb federal cap on Interstates. For heavy haulers, that means running one trip at 100,000 lbs instead of splitting into two at 80,000 lbs. The economics are significant. But Maine pairs that weight advantage with the highest state insurance minimums in the region: $50,000/$100,000/$25,000 for BI/PD -- three to four times higher than Pennsylvania or New Jersey. Maine also mandates UM, UIM, and MedPay coverages on top of the liability requirements.

The state is big -- over 320 miles from Kittery to Fort Kent -- and the northern half is genuinely remote. The Maine Turnpike (I-95 from Kittery to Augusta) is tolled at roughly $32 cash or $16-20 with E-ZPass for a 5-axle truck. North of Augusta, I-95 runs 222 miles to the Canadian border completely free. North of Bangor, distances between services become extreme. Limited truck stops, scarce fuel, and few repair facilities define the Aroostook County corridor. Running out of fuel in January up there is a survival situation, not just an inconvenience.

Spring frost laws from March through May reduce weight limits 10-25% on secondary and posted roads during the thaw, which can strand heavy loads on the Interstate system if delivery points require secondary road access. In winter, frozen ground conditions offer a bonus: roughly 10% additional weight tolerance for bulk commodities. For interstate carriers, the $750,000 federal minimum applies. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL -- Maine's rural highways at 70 mph with long EMS response times produce high-severity outcomes, and the $100,000 per-accident BI minimum is a floor, not a ceiling.
