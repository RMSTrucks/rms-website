North Carolina bridges the coast and the mountains. I-95 runs the eastern flatlands, I-85 threads the Piedmont through Charlotte, and I-40 crosses the Blue Ridge from the Tennessee Smokies to the Port of Wilmington. What connects them is a statewide left-lane ban that every trucker needs to know: vehicles with 3 or more axles or weighing 26,000 lbs or more cannot use the far-left lane on any NC interstate. It is enforced, and it applies everywhere.

North Carolina has the highest personal auto bodily injury minimums in the Southeast at $30K/$60K/$25K, and intrastate motor carriers must carry $750,000 minimum liability -- matching the federal floor. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL. Charlotte is growing fast as a distribution center, the I-85 corridor between Charlotte and the Triad is increasingly congested, and the Blue Ridge mountain grades on I-40 between mile markers 20 and 55 demand respect from November through March.

The tandem axle limit on North Carolina state highways is 38,000 lbs -- a full 4,000 lbs above the federal 34,000 lb standard. Interstates follow the federal limit, but for carriers running state routes, this weight advantage matters. The I-77 Express Lanes in Charlotte prohibit trucks with 3 or more axles outright, so do not plan on using them. NC Quick Pass is E-ZPass compatible and covers the Triangle Expressway and Monroe Expressway, with proper transponder setup for commercial vehicles available by calling 1-877-769-7277.
