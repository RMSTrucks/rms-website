faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Wisconsin?"
    answer: "Wisconsin intrastate minimums are $25,000/$50,000 bodily injury and $10,000 property damage -- the lowest PD minimum in the Midwest. CMVs over 10,001 lbs need $750,000 for non-hazmat operations. RMS strongly recommends $1M CSL because the $10,000 PD minimum will not cover even a minor fender bender."
  - question: "What is Wisconsin's frozen road weight program?"
    answer: "When ground is frozen 18 inches or deeper (typically mid-December through late February), vehicles hauling raw forest products or road salt can carry up to 98,000 lbs on 5+ axle vehicles -- no permit required. That is 22.5 percent above the standard 80,000 lb limit. No other state offers this program."
  - question: "Do I need insurance on file before I can register my truck in Wisconsin?"
    answer: "Yes. Wisconsin is an insurance-first state. Proof of liability insurance must be on file with WisDOT BEFORE you can get vehicle registration, registration trip permits, or operating authority."
  - question: "Where are the weigh stations (SWEFs) in Wisconsin?"
    answer: "Wisconsin calls them Safety and Weight Enforcement Facilities (SWEFs). There are 11 locations including Pleasant Prairie (I-94 NB MP 349), Warren (I-94 EB MP 8), Pleasant Springs (I-39/90 SB MP 145), and Kaukauna (I-41 NB MP 153). Vehicles over 10,000 lbs must stop."
  - question: "Are there toll roads in Wisconsin?"
    answer: "No. Wisconsin has zero toll roads. All interstates and state highways are free to drive. This is a significant cost advantage over neighboring Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio."
  - question: "When do spring thaw restrictions apply in Wisconsin?"
    answer: "Spring thaw restrictions typically apply to Class 2 roads from early March through mid-May. Weight limits are reduced during this period to prevent road damage. Interstates are generally not affected."

Wisconsin runs on dairy, forest products, and paper -- and the trucking industry that moves all of it. I-94 through Milwaukee carries roughly 33,000 trucks per day at peak, making it one of the busiest freight corridors in the Midwest. The state has no toll roads anywhere (a notable advantage over Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio), and its weigh stations go by "Safety and Weight Enforcement Facilities" or SWEFs. Wisconsin is also an insurance-first state: proof of liability must be on file with WisDOT before you can register a vehicle, get a trip permit, or obtain operating authority. If you show up without coverage on file, you are not moving.

The standout regulation is the frozen road program. When ground freezes to 18 inches or deeper -- typically mid-December through late February -- vehicles hauling raw forest products or road salt can carry up to 98,000 lbs on 5+ axle vehicles without a permit. That is 22.5 percent above the standard 80,000 lb GVW limit, and no other state in the country offers anything like it. Forest product haulers time their heaviest loads to coincide with frozen road declarations, and it directly impacts revenue per trip. On the flip side, spring thaw restrictions on Class 2 roads (early March through mid-May) can shut down the same routes when the ground softens.

Wisconsin's $10,000 property damage minimum is the lowest in the Midwest, and it is dangerously inadequate. One minor collision with a passenger vehicle will blow past that limit. RMS strongly recommends $1M CSL for any Wisconsin operation -- the gap between the state minimum and real-world accident costs is wider here than in any neighboring state. Winter driving adds another layer: Lake Superior's snow belt and Lake Michigan lake-effect create severe conditions across the northern and eastern corridors, particularly on I-43 and I-90 through the Driftless Area.
