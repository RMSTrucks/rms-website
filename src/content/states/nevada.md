faqItems:
  - question: "What is Nevada SB 180?"
    answer: "Nevada is doubling intrastate trucking liability insurance from $750,000 to $1.5M in three phases: $1M by January 2026, $1.25M by January 2028, $1.5M by January 2030. This affects all intrastate carriers with vehicles 26,001+ lbs."
  - question: "Where do I fuel on Nevada I-80?"
    answer: "Major stops: Sparks/Reno, Fernley, Lovelock, Winnemucca (critical hub), Battle Mountain, Elko (major hub), Wells, Wendover. Keep your tank above half at all times. The real danger is getting off I-80 onto secondary routes where fuel can be 100+ miles apart."
  - question: "Does Nevada have weigh stations?"
    answer: "Not permanent fixed ones. Nevada uses portable scales and surprise enforcement operations. They are unpredictable -- stations can be closed for weeks, then run intensive blitzes. PrePass and Drivewyze work when stations are active."
  - question: "What is the Washoe Valley wind restriction?"
    answer: "High-profile vehicles 9+ feet tall (including semi-trucks) are prohibited during high winds in Washoe Valley between Reno and Carson City. Alerts are posted on electronic signs, highway radio, and 511 Nevada. This is actively enforced."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for Nevada?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 federal minimum (we recommend $1M). Intrastate carriers currently need $750,000, increasing to $1M by January 2026 under SB 180. Plan ahead -- premiums are going up."
  - question: "Is there a truck parking problem in Nevada?"
    answer: "Severe. Clark County (Las Vegas) has a 550+ space deficit. Washoe County (Reno) has a 250+ deficit. US-93 between Las Vegas and Ely has ZERO facilities with amenities for two hours. Plan your HOS before entering Nevada."
  - question: "How do I get operating authority in Nevada?"
    answer: "Interstate: standard FMCSA process (USDOT, MC number, BOC-3). Intrastate common goods: DMV Motor Carrier Division, Form MC 208, insurance filing. Fully-regulated carriers (passengers, household goods): Nevada Transportation Authority."

Nevada is doubling intrastate trucking liability insurance from $750,000 to $1.5M by 2030 under [SB 180](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/insurance-changes/). The increases are phased: $1M by January 2026, $1.25M by January 2028, $1.5M by January 2030. This affects all intrastate carriers operating vehicles over 26,001 lbs. Carriers currently running at state minimums need to budget for premium increases now, not when the deadlines arrive.

I-80 across Nevada is 410 miles of sparse desert where fuel stops can be 50+ miles apart and secondary routes like US-93 and US-95 can stretch 100+ miles between services. The [fuel planning guide](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/i80-fuel-guide/) for this corridor is not optional reading -- it is survival planning. Keep your tank above half at all times. The real danger is not I-80 itself, where stops at Winnemucca and Elko are reliable, but the moment you turn off onto a secondary route.

Nevada does not maintain permanent fixed weigh stations. Enforcement is through portable scales and surprise operations, making it [unpredictable](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/winter-wind/) compared to states with permanent facilities. The Washoe Valley wind restriction between Reno and Carson City prohibits high-profile vehicles 9+ feet tall during high winds -- this is actively enforced and will shut down your route without warning.

The [truck parking crisis](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/truck-parking/) is severe: Clark County around Las Vegas has a 550+ space deficit, Washoe County around Reno has 250+ spaces fewer than needed, and US-93 between Las Vegas and Ely has zero amenity parking for a two-hour stretch. Plan your hours of service before entering Nevada. Do not rely on finding parking.
