faqItems:
  - question: "What are Colorado's three chain laws?"
    answer: "Colorado has three separate chain/traction laws: the Passenger Traction Law (Code 15/16) for vehicles under 16,001 lbs, the CMV Chain Law requiring chains on four drive wheel tires for vehicles 16,001+ lbs when activated on I-70 and other mountain highways, and the Must Carry Law (signed 2024) requiring CMVs to carry chains September 1 through May 31 on 1,400+ miles of highway."
  - question: "Can hazmat trucks use the Eisenhower Tunnel?"
    answer: "No. All placarded hazmat is prohibited in the Eisenhower Tunnel. You must use Loveland Pass (US-6) at 11,990 ft with steep switchbacks. When Loveland Pass closes for weather, CDOT may escort hazmat through the tunnel on an hourly basis."
  - question: "What insurance do I need for Colorado trucking?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum federal liability (we recommend $1M). Intrastate carriers must register with the Colorado PUC and file insurance accordingly. Mountain operations significantly increase claim severity, making higher limits essential."
  - question: "How much are Colorado chain law fines?"
    answer: "Chain law non-compliance carries a $100+ fine plus surcharges. Blocking a roadway due to non-compliance can result in fines over $1,000. Not carrying chains during Must Carry season (September through May) is a $50+ fine. Truck speeding in Glenwood Canyon carries double fines."
  - question: "What is the height clearance at Eisenhower Tunnel?"
    answer: "The clearance is 13 feet 11 inches. Loads over 11 feet wide must pull over and call CDOT for clearance before proceeding. Metering during peak periods can cause delays."
  - question: "Where do I chain up on I-70?"
    answer: "There are 20+ designated chain stations between Lakewood (MP 263) and Dotsero (MP 133). Key eastbound stations include Vail Pass bottom (MP 178), Copper Mountain (MP 195), and Dillon (MP 205). Westbound stations include Buffalo Overlook (MP 254), Herman Gulch (MP 219), and Vail Pass (MP 179)."
  - question: "Do I need a PUC registration for Colorado?"
    answer: "If you operate intrastate for-hire in Colorado, yes. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission regulates intrastate carriers separately under 4 CCR 723-6. File your application and insurance with PUC. Interstate carriers follow the standard FMCSA process."

Colorado is defined by I-70 through the Rocky Mountains -- one of America's most demanding trucking corridors. The 126-mile chain law zone between Dotsero and Morrison climbs past the Eisenhower Tunnel at 11,158 feet, the highest point on the Interstate Highway System, where all placarded hazmat is banned. The only legal alternative is Loveland Pass at 11,990 feet with steep switchbacks and avalanche risk.

The state enforces three separate chain and traction laws, a distinction most trucking sites fail to explain clearly. The Passenger Traction Law applies to lighter vehicles. The CMV Chain Law requires chains on at least four drive wheel tires when activated, primarily along I-70 between MP 133 and MP 259. And the Must Carry Law, signed in 2024 by Governor Polis, requires commercial vehicles 16,001 lbs and over to carry approved chains from September 1 through May 31 across 1,400+ miles of designated highway. Clip-on chains are prohibited under all three.

Beyond the mountains, I-25 forms the Front Range spine from Trinidad at the New Mexico border through Denver to Fort Collins near Wyoming. Colorado's PUC regulates intrastate carriers separately from FMCSA, adding a state-level filing requirement that catches new authorities off guard. Interstate carriers carry $750,000 federal minimum liability, but mountain driving changes the math on what "enough" coverage looks like. A loaded truck losing brakes on Vail Pass or Floyd Hill generates catastrophic claims that make state minimums of $25,000/$50,000/$15,000 look like pocket change. We recommend $1,000,000 combined single limit for any carrier running Colorado's mountain corridors.
