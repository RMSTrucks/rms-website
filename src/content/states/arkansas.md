faqItems:
  - question: "Are there any toll roads in Arkansas?"
    answer: "No. Arkansas is completely toll-free -- no toll roads, no toll bridges on any state highway or interstate. The state has studied tolls multiple times and rejected them each time."
  - question: "What makes Northwest Arkansas so important for trucking?"
    answer: "Northwest Arkansas is home to Walmart HQ (Bentonville), Tyson Foods (Springdale), and J.B. Hunt Transport (Lowell). This concentration of major companies creates one of the densest freight corridors in the South-Central US, with heavy truck traffic on I-49 and US-71."
  - question: "Is the I-30 construction in Little Rock still active?"
    answer: "The 30 Crossing Project (4.7 miles of I-30/I-40 interchange reconstruction) was substantially completed in November 2024. The rebuilt interchange should be in good condition for through-traffic."
  - question: "What is the biggest weather hazard for trucking in Arkansas?"
    answer: "Ice storms, especially in the Ozark Mountains of Northwest Arkansas. Bridge icing is the primary risk -- Arkansas has many river crossings where bridges freeze before road surfaces. The Ozark region sees the most challenging winter conditions."
  - question: "Is workers' compensation required in Arkansas?"
    answer: "Yes. Unlike Texas, workers' compensation insurance is mandatory in Arkansas for employers with three or more employees."
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Arkansas?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum liability coverage per FMCSA. Arkansas state minimums for intrastate are $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 split limits. Intrastate for-hire carriers must file proof of insurance with ArDOT. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL."

Arkansas sits where Southeast freight meets South-Central logistics. I-40 runs 284 miles east-west from Memphis to Oklahoma, I-30 connects Dallas to Little Rock across 143 miles, and I-49 threads through the northwest corner where three of the biggest names in American freight -- Walmart, Tyson Foods, and J.B. Hunt Transport -- all have their headquarters within 30 miles of each other.

That Northwest Arkansas concentration is the story. Bentonville (Walmart HQ), Springdale (Tyson Foods), and Lowell (J.B. Hunt) generate massive freight volumes through a metro area that is among the fastest-growing in the country. Distribution centers cluster along I-49 and US-71, and truck traffic in the Fayetteville-Bentonville corridor keeps growing.

Arkansas is completely toll-free. No toll roads, no toll bridges, nothing. The state has studied tolling multiple times and rejected it each time. That is a genuine operating cost advantage over neighboring Oklahoma (where I-44 becomes tolled at the border) and Texas. The 30 Crossing Project -- a 4.7-mile reconstruction of the I-30/I-40 interchange in Little Rock -- was substantially completed in November 2024, so that chokepoint should be clear.

The weather hazard here is ice, not snow. Ice storms hit hardest in the Ozark Mountains of northwest Arkansas, and bridge icing is the real danger across a state with dozens of river crossings. Arkansas Highway Police are nationally recognized for drug interdiction during commercial vehicle stops, so keep documentation organized and accessible. Eleven weigh stations sit near state borders on major corridors, and Drivewyze PreClear is active at most locations. Insurance rates run moderate -- lower than Louisiana and Texas, comparable to Tennessee and Alabama.
