faqItems:
  - question: "Can I really haul 99,000 lbs on Vermont Interstates without a permit?"
    answer: "Yes. Vermont allows 99,000 lbs on non-tolled Interstates (I-89, I-91, I-93, I-189) with a 6-axle configuration. This is authorized under a federal pilot program that has been extended for 20 years. No special permit is needed for properly configured 6-axle combinations up to 99,000 lbs. For loads above 99,000 lbs (up to 150,000 lbs), use the VT Haul Pass system for permits."
  - question: "Where is the chain law enforced in Vermont?"
    answer: "Vermont's mandatory chain law applies to heavy-duty vehicles with GVWR or GCWR over 26,000 lbs during snowy or icy conditions on designated highways. The currently designated chain control area is Route 9 (Molly Stark Trail) between Wilmington and Bennington -- roughly 20 miles through the Green Mountains. The state can designate additional highways based on conditions. Chains are required on both the motor vehicle and towed trailers."
  - question: "How limited is truck parking in Vermont?"
    answer: "Vermont has the most limited truck infrastructure of any state in our coverage area. Known parking includes Maplewood Store near I-89 Exit 7 (6 spaces), Shell near I-89 Exit 21 (10 spaces), and Springfield Irving near I-91 Exit 7 (17 spaces with 24/7 diesel). Beyond these, options are extremely scarce. Plan overnight stops carefully and consider stopping in New Hampshire or Massachusetts if Vermont parking is full."
  - question: "How does Vermont's weight exemption compare to Maine's?"
    answer: "Vermont allows 99,000 lbs on non-tolled Interstates; Maine allows 100,000 lbs on all Interstates. Both require 6-axle configurations and neither requires special permits at the exemption weight. Vermont's program comes from a federal pilot program extended for 20 years. Maine's is authorized under 23 USC Section 127(a)(11). The programs are nearly identical in practical operation."
  - question: "What are the oversize/overweight restrictions during summer in Vermont?"
    answer: "Loads over 108,000 lbs, 12 feet wide, or 100 feet long cannot move on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. A summer restriction from July 1 through Labor Day applies the same prohibition. Speed is limited to 45 mph for loads over 90,000 lbs, 10 feet wide, or 75 feet long. Permits through VT Haul Pass do not override posted road restrictions."
  - question: "Does Vermont have toll roads?"
    answer: "No. Vermont has no toll roads, no toll bridges, and no toll tunnels. This is a significant operating cost advantage -- there are zero tolling costs for Vermont operations. However, if you are connecting to New Hampshire, Massachusetts, or New York, E-ZPass will be needed for those neighboring states."

Vermont is one of only two states -- Maine is the other -- where you can legally exceed the federal 80,000 lb Interstate weight cap without a special permit. Vermont allows 99,000 lbs on non-tolled Interstates (I-89, I-91, I-93, I-189) with a 6-axle configuration, authorized under a federal pilot program extended for 20 years. For heavy haulers, the economics mirror Maine: one trip at 99,000 lbs replaces two trips at 80,000 lbs. But Vermont pairs that weight advantage with the Green Mountains, a mandatory chain law, and the most limited truck infrastructure of any state in our coverage area.

The chain law is the detail that catches people off guard. Vermont is one of the few Northeast states with a mandatory chain requirement for heavy-duty vehicles over 26,000 lbs GVWR/GCWR. The currently designated chain control area is Route 9 (Molly Stark Trail) between Wilmington and Bennington -- roughly 20 miles through the Green Mountains notorious for winter conditions. The state can designate other highways as chain control areas based on conditions, and enforcement is active. Chains must go on both the motor vehicle and any towed trailers.

Infrastructure is the other challenge. Vermont has very few truck stops statewide. Known parking includes Maplewood Store near I-89 Exit 7 with 6 spaces, Shell near I-89 Exit 21 with 10 spaces, and Springfield Irving near I-91 Exit 7 with 17 spaces and 24/7 diesel. Beyond those, options are extremely scarce. Fuel gaps of 50-plus miles exist in northern Vermont. The state has no toll roads, no toll bridges, and no toll tunnels -- a genuine operating cost advantage -- but the trade-off is sparse infrastructure that requires advance planning for every run. State insurance minimums are $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 for BI/PD. For interstate carriers, the $750,000 federal minimum applies, and RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL given the mountain terrain and limited emergency services.
