faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Nebraska?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum per FMCSA. Nebraska state minimums for intrastate are $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 split limits. Nebraska PSC regulates intrastate for-hire carriers with Form E filing required. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL given the I-80 exposure."
  - question: "How often does I-80 close in Nebraska during winter?"
    answer: "NDOT and State Patrol actively close I-80 from Kearney west during severe winter storms. Closures can last multiple days. Western Nebraska from North Platte to Wyoming is the most exposed section. Check 511.nebraska.gov for real-time conditions before heading west."
  - question: "Where are the cell dead zones on I-80 in Nebraska?"
    answer: "Cell coverage is good from Omaha to Kearney, spotty from Kearney to North Platte, and weak to nonexistent in western Nebraska from North Platte to Wyoming. Western Nebraska has some of the worst rural cell coverage in the lower 48. Download offline maps before heading west."
  - question: "Are there toll roads in Nebraska?"
    answer: "No. Nebraska has no toll roads on any highway or interstate."
  - question: "What is the wind restriction for oversize loads in Nebraska?"
    answer: "Overdimensional loads are prohibited when winds exceed 25 mph. This is critical in Nebraska where high winds are frequent, especially in western Nebraska. Overweight-only loads with legal dimensions are NOT restricted by weather."
  - question: "Where are the truck stops on I-80 in western Nebraska?"
    answer: "Commercial stops cluster at Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Kearney, North Platte, Ogallala, and Sidney. Western Nebraska has long gaps between fuel stops. Most I-80 rest areas hold only 6-12 trucks despite massive traffic volumes. Plan fuel stops carefully west of Kearney."

I-80 through Nebraska runs 455 miles from Omaha to the Wyoming border with rest areas that hold 6-12 trucks, cell dead zones west of Kearney, and winter closures that last for days. This is not a corridor that forgives poor planning.

The route breaks into distinct segments. Omaha to Lincoln (55 miles) is the urban corridor with the highest traffic. Lincoln to Grand Island (100 miles) crosses agricultural heartland. Grand Island to North Platte (100 miles) opens into flat prairie. North Platte to Ogallala (55 miles) enters the Sandhills. Ogallala to Sidney (60 miles) climbs through high plains. And Sidney to Wyoming (85 miles) approaches 4,000 feet of elevation. Each segment gets more remote and more exposed.

Cell coverage is good from Omaha to Kearney, spotty from Kearney to North Platte, and weak to nonexistent in western Nebraska. That last stretch from North Platte to Wyoming has some of the worst rural cell coverage in the lower 48. Download offline maps before heading west. NDOT and the State Patrol actively close I-80 from Kearney west during severe winter storms -- blizzards and ground blizzards on open prairie create zero-visibility conditions. Closures can last multiple days.

Nebraska has no toll roads, no chain law, and a 75 mph uniform speed limit. Studded tires are permitted November 1 through April 1. Overdimensional loads are prohibited when winds exceed 25 mph, which is critical in a state where high winds are frequent. The Nebraska PSC regulates intrastate for-hire carriers, and the DMV operates a One-Stop Shop for IRP, IFTA, and UCR. Insurance rates are low thanks to the rural nature of the state, but I-80 winter exposure creates real severity risk. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL.
