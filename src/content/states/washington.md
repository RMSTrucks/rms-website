  - question: "How much is the chain law fine in Washington?"
    answer: "$500. One of the highest in the West. Chains are required on Snoqualmie Pass (69 miles, MP 32 to MP 101) and other mountain passes when posted. Studded tires do NOT count as chains."
  - question: "What is the NWSA Clean Truck Program?"

Washington has a uniform 60 mph maximum speed limit for all trucks over 10,000 lbs -- statewide, no exceptions. It is one of the lowest truck speed limits in the West, and it catches every out-of-state driver. There is no rural exception, no highway-by-highway variance. If you weigh over 10,000 lbs and you are in Washington, your speed limit is 60.

Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 is the other defining feature. The [chain zone stretches 69 miles](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/snoqualmie-pass/) from North Bend at milepost 32 to Ellensburg at milepost 101, with $500 fines for non-compliance -- one of the highest chain penalties in the region. Studded tires do not count as chains. Oversize loads are prohibited during chain conditions. Washington State Patrol actively checks eastbound vehicles at the North Bend base.

The [Northwest Seaport Alliance](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/seattle-tacoma/) -- the jointly operated ports of Seattle and Tacoma -- is launching its Clean Truck Program in January 2026. All trucks serving international and domestic terminals will need a registered RFID tag and a 2007 or newer engine. A $6.2 million zero-emission drayage incentive program is backing the transition. Carriers serving these ports should register before the deadline.

Washington splits regulatory authority four ways: WSDOT handles permits and road conditions, WSP handles enforcement and inspections, UTC handles intrastate for-hire authority and insurance filing, and DOL handles vehicle registration and CDL. This [four-agency structure](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/permits/) confuses every new carrier, but understanding who does what prevents wasted time and missed filings. The state's $10,000 property damage minimum is the lowest among western states -- a number so low it would not cover a scratch on a modern truck. UTC requires $750,000 CSL for intrastate carriers over 10,000 lbs, and we recommend $1M given Puget Sound congestion and Snoqualmie Pass severity.
