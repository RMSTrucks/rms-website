faqItems:
  - question: "How dangerous is Monteagle Mountain for trucks?"
    answer: "Extremely dangerous. I-24 between MM 134 and MM 155 has a sustained 6% grade with runaway truck ramps along the descent. Brake failure incidents happen regularly. Check your brakes before the descent, and in winter expect chain control postings."
  - question: "Can I take my truck through Great Smoky Mountains National Park?"
    answer: "No. Commercial vehicles are prohibited on all park highways under TN Code 11-18-107. You must use I-40 to cross the Smokies."
  - question: "Can I use a 53-foot trailer on Tennessee roads?"
    answer: "On interstates and National Network highways, yes. Tennessee standard trailer limit is 50 feet for non-National Network routes. Verify your route before leaving the interstate with a 53-foot trailer."
  - question: "Is there a truck speed limit in Tennessee?"
    answer: "No differential speed limit. Trucks follow the same limits as cars: 70 mph rural, 65 mph urban, 55 mph in construction zones."
  - question: "Are Tennessee interstates toll-free?"
    answer: "Yes, all of them. I-40, I-65, I-75, I-24, and I-81 are completely toll-free. Future Choice Lanes are planned to exempt trucks."
  - question: "Where can I find truck parking in Tennessee?"
    answer: "It is tight. Seventy-three facilities operate at 75% or higher utilization, averaging 89.9% full. Tennessee has designated Interstate Truck-Only Parking Areas. Plan ahead and reserve when possible."

Tennessee has two things every trucker needs to respect: mountains and freight volume. I-40 runs all 455 miles across the state -- the longest segment of that interstate in any single state -- and 14 of Tennessee's 22 weigh stations sit along it. The Memphis-Nashville-Knoxville freight triangle is the distribution backbone of the Southeast, and two genuinely dangerous mountain grades stand between you and either border.

Monteagle Mountain on I-24 drops 1,764 feet in 4 miles at a sustained 6% grade. The runaway truck ramp at mile 152 exists because truckers who skip the brake check do not make the curve at the bottom. I-40 through the Smokies between mile markers 430 and 451 is one of the most treacherous truck routes in the eastern United States -- tight curves, limited shoulders, winter closures, and grades that punish overconfidence. Commercial vehicles are banned from all Great Smoky Mountains National Park highways, so I-40 is not optional. It is your only legal crossing.

Tennessee commercial insurance requirements are tiered by weight: 10,001 to 26,000 lbs requires $300,000 liability, and vehicles over 26,001 lbs require $750,000 -- matching the federal floor. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for any carrier operating in Tennessee. One brake failure descent on Monteagle or one chain-reaction incident in Nashville rush hour can produce a catastrophic claim that blows through $750K before the adjuster arrives. Tennessee truck parking crisis compounds the risk: 73 facilities averaging 89.9% utilization means fatigued drivers competing for spaces, and fatigue is the silent underwriter of most mountain incidents.
