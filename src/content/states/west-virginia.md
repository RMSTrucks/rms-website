faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in West Virginia?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum per FMCSA. WV PSC requires $300,000 CSL minimum for intrastate property carriers. State minimums for personal vehicles are $25,000/$50,000/$25,000 split limits. UM/UIM coverage is mandatory and cannot be waived. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL."
  - question: "How much are WV Turnpike tolls for a semi?"
    answer: "The WV Turnpike has three toll plazas (Ghent, Pax, Chelyan). For a 5-axle truck, total cost is $36 with WV-issued E-ZPass, $39 with non-WV E-ZPass, or $45 cash. E-ZPass IS accepted here, unlike the Kansas and Oklahoma turnpikes."
  - question: "Is West Virginia really that mountainous for trucking?"
    answer: "Yes. West Virginia is entirely mountainous -- there is no flat terrain anywhere in the state. Every interstate involves significant grades, curves, and elevation changes. The I-77 approach from Virginia (Fancy Gap) has 6% grades and three runaway truck ramps. Budget 30-50% more time than GPS estimates."
  - question: "What is the weight limit on local roads in West Virginia?"
    answer: "Local service routes in West Virginia have a 65,000 lb GVW limit, compared to 80,000 lb on Interstates and STRAHNET routes. Many WV roads are NOT Interstate or STRAHNET classified. Know your route classification before running a loaded truck on secondary roads."
  - question: "Is UM/UIM coverage mandatory in West Virginia?"
    answer: "Yes. Uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is mandatory in West Virginia and cannot be waived. This is unique among neighboring states and directly affects insurance costs. It provides important protection on mountain roads where accident severity is higher."
  - question: "Where should I check my brakes before entering West Virginia?"
    answer: "Check brakes before entering WV from any direction. If southbound on I-77 from Ohio, check at Parkersburg. If northbound on I-77 from Virginia, Fancy Gap has brake check areas before the descent. Engine braking (jake brakes) is essential on WV grades, though some communities restrict their use -- check local ordinances."

West Virginia is entirely mountainous. There is no flat terrain anywhere in the state. Every interstate involves significant grades, curves, and elevation changes. The I-77 approach from Virginia through Fancy Gap has 6% grades and three runaway truck ramps in the first six miles. If you do not check your brakes before entering West Virginia, you are gambling with your life.

The WV Turnpike (I-77/I-64) runs 88 miles through mountain terrain with three toll plazas at Ghent, Pax, and Chelyan. E-ZPass is accepted -- unlike the Kansas and Oklahoma turnpikes -- and a WV-issued E-ZPass gets the best rate ($36 for all three plazas versus $45 cash for a 5-axle truck). The Turnpike is the best-maintained mountain road in the state, but it is still mountain driving with real grades throughout.

Cell coverage is spotty across West Virginia due to mountain terrain. The worst gaps are on I-77 between Princeton and Beckley and on I-64 from the Virginia border to Beckley. Download offline maps before entering the state. Fog in river valleys -- the Kanawha, Ohio, and New River -- can reduce visibility to zero. Snow accumulates 40-60 inches annually at higher elevations, and ice storms hit November through March.

Local service routes carry a 65,000 lb GVW limit versus 80,000 lb on Interstates. Many WV roads are not Interstate or STRAHNET classified, and running an overweight truck on a local route brings immediate fines. UM/UIM coverage is mandatory in West Virginia and cannot be waived, which is unique among neighboring states and adds to policy costs. The WV PSC requires $300,000 CSL minimum for intrastate property carriers. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL given the mountain driving risk, fog, ice, and the mandatory UM/UIM.
