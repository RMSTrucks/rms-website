Illinois is the freight capital of the Midwest, and that title runs through Chicago. Five major interstates -- I-90, I-94, I-80, I-55, and I-57 -- converge in the metro area, creating one of the densest freight networks in the country. Roughly 260 inspection stations perform over 400,000 vehicle inspections annually, and truck parking runs at 94 percent utilization statewide, making Illinois one of the hardest states in the region to find a legal spot for the night. The state operates two separate toll systems: the Illinois Tollway (7 roads, 294 miles) and the privately-operated Chicago Skyway on I-90, where 5-axle tolls are climbing past $66 in 2026.

What catches out-of-state drivers off guard is the truck speed split. In Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties, trucks over 8,001 lbs are capped at 60 mph while cars get 70 mph. Illinois State Police enforce the differential aggressively, and the tickets are not cheap. Add in Chicago's municipal code -- Inner Loop freight bans, boulevard restrictions, residential parking prohibitions -- and the metro becomes its own regulatory environment that rewards preparation.

The biggest infrastructure story in Illinois right now is the $1.2 billion I-80 rebuild in Will County. Sixteen miles from Ridge Road to US 30 are being reconstructed through the end of 2028, affecting 80,000+ vehicles daily (25 percent of them trucks). The I-55/I-80 interchange ramps are being rebuilt in phases, with new flyover connections coming online through 2026. For carriers running east-west through northern Illinois, this project is a daily planning factor -- check [i80will.org](https://i80will.org) for live ramp closures and detour routing. Meanwhile, the state is investing $197.5 million to add 100+ truck parking spaces at rest areas along I-24, I-55, and other corridors, with TPIMS real-time availability technology.
