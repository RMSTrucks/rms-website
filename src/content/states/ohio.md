Ohio logged 27.5 million truck miles in 2023, and that number is heading up -- freight volume is projected to increase 26 percent by 2045. Four major interstates cross the state: I-80 (the Ohio Turnpike), I-70 through Columbus, I-75 from Cincinnati to Toledo, and I-71 connecting Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati in the state's freight triangle. With no split speed limit -- trucks and cars both get 70 mph -- Ohio treats commercial vehicles more fairly than most of its neighbors.

The standout tool for any trucker running Ohio is [OHGO](https://www.ohgo.com). It is the best state DOT platform in the country, providing real-time traffic cameras, incident reporting, construction zones, weather conditions, and live truck parking availability through both a website and mobile app. OHGO's public API exposes 9 endpoints including a dedicated Truck Parking feed, which means real-time parking data can be integrated directly into routing decisions. No other state gives truckers this level of free, accessible operational intelligence.

Ohio's biggest infrastructure investment is in truck parking. The state is spending $150 million to add 1,400+ new spaces at 33 sites, with construction starting in 2026 and completion targeted for end of 2027. This will more than double state-owned capacity to 3,100+ spots. Meanwhile, lake-effect snow from Lake Erie hammers the I-90 corridor through Ashtabula, Lake, and Cuyahoga counties -- whiteout conditions can materialize with little warning. The Turnpike runs 241 miles across northern Ohio at $58.75 for a 5-axle E-ZPass westbound, making toll math a real factor for carriers running the I-80 transcontinental route.
