faqItems:
  - question: "What insurance do I need to truck in Kansas?"
    answer: "Interstate carriers need $750,000 minimum per FMCSA. Kansas KCC intrastate minimums are $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident, and $50,000 property damage. Form E (liability) and Form H (cargo, $3,000 minimum) are filed with KCC. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL."
  - question: "Does E-ZPass work on the Kansas Turnpike?"
    answer: "No. E-ZPass is not accepted on the Kansas Turnpike. You need K-TAG, PikePass (Oklahoma), TxTag or TollTag (Texas), BestPass, or PrePass. The Turnpike went all-electronic in July 2024 -- no cash lanes exist. Without a compatible transponder, you get billed by license plate at double the K-TAG rate."
  - question: "How bad is the wind on I-70 in western Kansas?"
    answer: "Western Kansas I-70 from Hays to the Colorado border is one of the most wind-exposed corridors in the US. Crosswinds routinely exceed 50 mph and can flip empty trailers. KDOT may close sections during severe weather. High-profile vehicles are especially vulnerable."
  - question: "Do I need to attend a safety class to get Kansas intrastate authority?"
    answer: "Yes. Kansas is unique in requiring KCC safety class attendance as part of the intrastate authority application. The application fee is $250 plus the class requirement."
  - question: "What is the height limit for trucks in Kansas?"
    answer: "Kansas allows 14 feet, which is higher than the 13.5-13.6 foot standard in most states. Cylindrical hay bales get an exception up to 14.5 feet, reflecting the agricultural economy."
  - question: "Where are the weigh stations on I-70 in Kansas?"
    answer: "Key I-70 stations include Station 5A (westbound, KC area), Stations 21W/22W (westbound/eastbound at MP 329.5, Wabaunsee in the Flint Hills), and Station 46 (eastbound at MP 0.5, Kanorado at the Colorado border). All CMVs must stop at open stations."

I-70 crosses 424 miles of Kansas from Kansas City to Colorado, and west of Salina it becomes one of the most wind-exposed trucking corridors in the country. Crosswinds exceeding 50 mph can flip empty trailers. KDOT closes sections during severe weather. Cell coverage drops out between Hays and Colby, and again between Colby and the Colorado border. This is not a corridor to run unprepared.

The Kansas Turnpike runs 236 miles and went all-electronic in July 2024. There are no cash lanes anywhere. E-ZPass does not work -- you need K-TAG, PikePass (Oklahoma), TxTag or TollTag (Texas), BestPass, or PrePass. Without a compatible transponder, you get billed by license plate at $0.276 per mile, double the K-TAG rate of $0.138 per mile. East Coast carriers running through Kansas for the first time get hit with this surprise regularly.

Kansas has a 75 mph uniform speed limit with no truck speed split. The 14-foot height limit is more generous than most states (13.5-13.6 feet is standard), and trailer length runs to 59 feet 6 inches. KDOT provides real-time truck parking data through the TPIMS system covering I-70 and I-135 rest areas. Truck stop clusters sit at Salina, Hays, Colby, and the KC metro, but western Kansas has long stretches between services.

The Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) handles intrastate authority with a unique requirement: you must attend a KCC safety class to get your authority. The application fee is $250. KCC intrastate minimums are $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident, and $50,000 property damage -- better than some states but still far below the federal $750,000 interstate minimum. Insurance rates are low-to-moderate, driven primarily by western Kansas wind exposure and agricultural operations.
