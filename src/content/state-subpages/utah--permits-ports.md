## On-Site Permits: Utah's Unusual Convenience

Three of Utah's six Ports of Entry issue oversize/overweight permits directly on site. This is unusual -- most states require advance permit applications through an online portal or state office. In Utah, if you arrive at St. George, Echo, or Wendover with a load that needs a permit, you can get one at the gate. For carriers entering Utah with oversize or overweight loads, this means you can plan your entry through one of these three POEs and handle permitting without delay.

## Utah Ports of Entry

| Port of Entry | Interstate | Direction | Location | On-Site Permits |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| St. George | I-15 SB | Arizona border | Southern Utah | YES |
| Echo | I-80 WB | Wyoming border | Northeast Utah | YES |
| Wendover | I-80 EB | Nevada border | Western Utah | YES |
| Perry | I-15 | Northern Utah | Near Brigham City | No |
| Scipio | I-15 | Central Utah | Between Fillmore and Scipio | No |
| Daniels | US-40 | Wasatch County | East of Heber City | No |

### St. George (I-15 Southbound)

Located at the Arizona border on I-15, St. George is the primary entry point for northbound traffic from Las Vegas and Arizona. The port operates on the southbound side for vehicles entering Utah from the south. Permits are issued on site for oversized and overweight loads.

### Echo (I-80 Westbound)

Echo serves westbound I-80 traffic entering from Wyoming. Located near Echo Junction where I-80 and I-84 split, this is a high-volume port handling transcontinental I-80 traffic. On-site permits are available. The [Echo Canyon corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-utah/corridor-survival/) connects to Salt Lake City through mountainous terrain.

### Wendover (I-80 Eastbound)

Wendover handles eastbound traffic entering from Nevada across the Bonneville Salt Flats. On-site permits are available. This port is your last point of contact before entering the [Salt Flats corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-utah/corridor-survival/) where services are limited.

## Oversize/Overweight Permit Types

### Standard Overweight Permits

| Detail | Specification |
|--------|--------------|
| Maximum permitted GVW | 125,000 lbs |
| Standard axle limits | Federal bridge formula applies |
| Application | On-site at 3 POEs or through UDOT Motor Carrier Division |
| Contact | (801) 965-4892 or (866) 215-5399 |

### Superload Permits

Loads exceeding standard oversize thresholds fall into the superload category with additional requirements:

| Threshold | Superload Classification |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Height over 17 feet 6 inches | Superload |
| Width over 17 feet | Superload |
| Weight over 300,000 lbs | Superload |

- **Processing time:** Up to 14 business days
- **Movement restrictions:** Monday through Friday only
- **Route survey:** May be required for extreme dimensions
- **Escort requirements:** State Police escort at $300/day for qualifying loads

### Dimension Limits for Standard Permits

| Dimension | Standard Permit Limit | Over-limit Requires Superload |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Height | Up to 17'6" | Over 17'6" |
| Width | Up to 17' | Over 17' |
| Length | Varies by configuration | Contact UDOT |
| Weight | Up to 125,000 lbs GVW | Over 300,000 lbs |

## Operating Authority and Registration

### IFTA (International Fuel Tax Agreement)

Utah participates in IFTA. All qualified motor vehicles operating interstate must have a valid IFTA license and decals. File quarterly fuel tax reports with your base jurisdiction.

### UCR (Unified Carrier Registration)

Interstate for-hire carriers must maintain current UCR registration. This is a federal requirement enforced at Utah Ports of Entry.

### IRP (International Registration Plan)

Vehicles operating interstate must be registered under IRP with appropriate Utah mileage proportions.

### USDOT Number and MC Authority

All commercial vehicles must display a valid USDOT number. For-hire carriers need active MC authority. These are checked at Ports of Entry.

## I-15 Express Lanes

Utah's I-15 corridor includes Express Lanes with dynamic pricing between Riverdale and Spanish Fork. Vehicles over 18,000 GVW may face restrictions on these lanes -- verify current rules before planning routes through the Wasatch Front urban corridor.

## Weight Limits

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000 lbs (federal Interstate) |
| With overweight permit | Up to 125,000 lbs GVW |
| Superload | Over 300,000 lbs (with superload permit) |

## PrePass and Drivewyze

Both PrePass and Drivewyze operate at Utah Ports of Entry. Compliant carriers with active PrePass transponders or Drivewyze subscriptions can receive bypass signals. However, oversize and overweight loads with permits must still stop -- a green light bypass does not exempt permitted loads from port entry.

## Planning Your Entry

For oversized or overweight loads entering Utah, plan your route through one of the three POEs with on-site permitting:

1. **From Arizona/Nevada (south):** Enter at St. George on I-15
2. **From Wyoming (east):** Enter at Echo on I-80
3. **From Nevada (west):** Enter at Wendover on I-80

If entering from Idaho on I-15 or I-84, the Perry and Daniels ports do not issue permits on site -- secure your permit through UDOT Motor Carrier Division before arrival. [Colorado's COOPR permit system](/states/trucking-insurance-colorado/) provides an interesting comparison for digital permitting approaches.
