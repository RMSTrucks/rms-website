## Oregon Has More Hoops Than Most States

Oregon operating requirements are more complex than Idaho, Washington, or Nevada. The weight-mile tax, the insurance filing requirement BEFORE operating, and the Class 1A permit for intrastate carriers all add layers that other states do not have.

## Requirements by Carrier Type

| Requirement | Interstate | Intrastate For-Hire |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
| USDOT Number | Yes | Yes |
| MC Number | Yes | No |
| Oregon Motor Carrier Account | Yes | Yes |
| Insurance Filing with CCD | Within 60 days | Before operating |
| Weight-Mile Tax Registration | Over 26,000 lbs | Over 26,000 lbs |
| Class 1A Permit | No | Yes ($300 fee) |
| Liability Minimum | $750,000 federal | $750,000 with CCD |
| Cargo Insurance | Federal minimums | $10,000 minimum |

## Key Steps

### 1. Obtain USDOT Number
All carriers over 10,000 lbs GVW need a USDOT number. Interstate through FMCSA, intrastate through Oregon CCD.

### 2. Register Motor Carrier Account with CCD
Contact the Commerce and Compliance Division:
- Address: 455 Airport Road SE, Building A, Salem, OR 97301
- Phone: 503-378-5849

### 3. File Insurance
Insurance must be filed with CCD **BEFORE** operating on Oregon highways. Not after. This catches many out-of-state carriers.

### 4. Register for Weight-Mile Tax
All vehicles over 26,000 lbs must register for the [weight-mile tax](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/weight-mile-tax/). This replaces IFTA fuel tax in Oregon.

### 5. Class 1A Permit (Intrastate For-Hire Only)
- Application fee: $300
- Requires $750,000 liability insurance
- Requires $10,000 cargo insurance
- Register with Oregon Secretary of State

## Oregon Trucking Online

The Oregon Trucking Online portal handles most registration and filing. Use it for:
- Motor carrier account setup
- Weight-mile tax filing
- Temporary pass purchases
- Insurance status verification

## Timeline and Costs

| Item | Cost | Timeline |
|------|------|----------|
| USDOT Number | Free | 1-2 days |
| MC Number | $300 | 3-4 weeks |
| Class 1A Permit | $300 | 2-4 weeks |
| Insurance (annual) | $8,000-18,000+ | 1-3 days for quote |
| Weight-Mile Tax | Ongoing quarterly | Immediate |

## Why Oregon Costs More to Operate In

Compared to [Idaho](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/new-carrier/), Oregon adds several cost layers:

- Weight-mile tax (5-15% of fuel equivalent)
- Higher insurance minimum ($750K vs Idaho state minimum of $25K/$50K/$15K)
- Portland Heavy Vehicle Use Tax (additional local tax)
- More aggressive regulatory enforcement

Many carriers choose to base in Idaho and operate into Oregon to avoid these costs while still serving Pacific NW freight markets.
