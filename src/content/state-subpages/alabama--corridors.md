## I-65: Tennessee Border to Mobile (367 Miles)

I-65 is Alabama's freight spine, carrying north-south traffic from Nashville through Birmingham to the Port of Mobile. The corridor breaks into distinct segments, each with its own character.

### Northern Section: Tennessee to Birmingham

| Mile Marker | Feature | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| MM 355.5 | Athens weigh station | NB/SB, near Tennessee border |
| MM 320-350 | Huntsville/Decatur | Growing tech and defense freight market (Redstone Arsenal, Mazda-Toyota) |
| MM 310 | I-565 interchange | Access to Huntsville |
| MM 278 | Morris weigh station | NB/SB, north of Birmingham |
| MM 260-245 | Birmingham metro | Malfunction Junction construction zone |

The Huntsville-Decatur corridor between MM 320 and MM 350 is one of the fastest-growing freight markets in the Southeast. Redstone Arsenal generates defense logistics traffic, and the Mazda-Toyota manufacturing plant adds automotive freight. Truck traffic in this section has increased steadily.

### Malfunction Junction (MM 245-260)

The I-20/I-59/I-65 interchange in downtown Birmingham -- known as Malfunction Junction -- is under reconstruction through 2028 or later. This is the most complex interchange in Alabama, and the construction means:

- Lane shifts and reduced speeds throughout the project zone
- Temporary ramp closures that change routing
- Significant delays during peak hours (6-9 AM, 3-7 PM)
- Night work that may narrow lanes without warning

If you can bypass Birmingham entirely, consider US-31 or I-459 (the southern bypass) depending on your route. I-459 adds miles but avoids the construction zone.

### Southern Section: Birmingham to Mobile

| Mile Marker | Feature | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| MM 200-170 | Clanton/Prattville | Rural, moderate traffic |
| MM 170-168 | Montgomery area | Hyundai plant, I-85 interchange |
| MM 130-0 | South of Montgomery | Flat, straight, fatigue zone |
| MM 0-5 | Mobile | Port of Mobile, I-10 interchange |

The stretch south of Montgomery is flat, straight, and monotonous. Fatigue-related crashes are common here. Stay alert, take breaks, and watch for slower agricultural equipment entering from side roads.

## I-20/I-59: Mississippi to Georgia Through Birmingham

I-20 and I-59 share a combined routing through Birmingham before splitting -- I-20 continues east to Atlanta and I-59 turns northeast toward Chattanooga.

### Heflin: The Only Permanent Weigh Station

| Station | Location | Direction | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Heflin | MM 209-214 on I-20 | EB/WB | Only traditional permanent weigh station in Alabama |

Heflin near the Georgia border is the only permanent, traditional weigh station in the state. This is where Alabama concentrates its fixed enforcement on the I-20 corridor. Every other enforcement point relies on portable scales and roving patrols.

### The Portable Scale Reality

Unlike every neighboring state, Alabama does not rely on permanent weigh station infrastructure. The ALEA Motor Carrier Safety Unit operates roving patrols with portable scales. This means:

- You can be stopped and weighed on any highway, any time
- There is no "green light" to bypass -- there is nothing to bypass
- PrePass and Drivewyze have limited coverage because of minimal permanent infrastructure
- Officers focus on I-65, I-20, and routes near Birmingham and Mobile

Keep your paperwork current, your load legal, and your documentation accessible. Alabama's enforcement model means inspection can happen anywhere.

## I-10: Mississippi to Florida (66 Miles)

Alabama has the shortest I-10 segment of any state it passes through -- just 66 miles of Gulf Coast highway. But those 66 miles include the Port of Mobile, the George Wallace Tunnel, and the Jubilee Parkway toll bridge.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| George Wallace Tunnel | I-10 under the Mobile River, height restrictions apply |
| Jubilee Parkway | Toll bridge over Mobile Bay, no stopping |
| Port of Mobile access | Via I-65/I-10 interchange |
| Total distance | 66 miles (MS border to FL border) |

See the [Port of Mobile Trucking Guide](/states/trucking-insurance-alabama/port-mobile/) for detailed terminal access and tunnel restriction information.

## I-85: Montgomery to Georgia (80 Miles)

I-85 runs 80 miles from Montgomery to the Georgia border. There are no weigh stations on I-85 in Alabama. Traffic is moderate, and the corridor serves as a connector between Montgomery (Hyundai plant) and the Atlanta metro area.

## All Weigh Stations

| Station | Interstate | Mile Marker | Direction | Type |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Athens | I-65 | 355.5 | NB/SB | Weigh-in-motion |
| Morris | I-65 | 278 | NB/SB | Weigh-in-motion |
| Heflin | I-20 | 209-214 | EB/WB | Permanent (only traditional station) |
| Birmingham | I-20/I-59 | 100 | NB/SB | Weigh-in-motion |

Alabama operates 12 total weigh station locations, but most are weigh-in-motion rather than traditional pull-in scales. The real enforcement comes from ALEA roving patrols with portable scales.

## Truck Parking

Truck parking in Alabama concentrates at:

- **Birmingham metro:** Multiple truck stops near I-65/I-20 interchange
- **Montgomery:** Truck stops along I-65 and I-85
- **Mobile:** Near I-65/I-10 interchange
- **Decatur/Huntsville:** Along I-65 north corridor
- **I-65 rest areas:** Between Birmingham and Montgomery, and south of Montgomery

I-65 south of Montgomery has the longest gaps between services. Plan accordingly, especially for overnight parking.

## Weather and Seasonal Hazards

Alabama does not have a chain law, and significant winter weather is rare. However:

- **North Alabama (Huntsville/Birmingham):** Occasional ice storms and light snow can shut down roads. Alabama drivers are not experienced in winter conditions, increasing accident risk.
- **Gulf Coast (Mobile):** Hurricane season runs June through November. Port operations may close during tropical weather.
- **Statewide:** Summer thunderstorms can reduce visibility suddenly. Flash flooding affects low-lying areas, particularly along river crossings.

Alabama interstates are all toll-free. The 70 mph speed limit applies to all vehicles with no truck speed split. For insurance coverage on Alabama corridors, contact RMS at (208) 800-0640.
