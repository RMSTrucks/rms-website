## I-35: The NAFTA Corridor (504 Miles)

I-35 is the busiest commercial corridor in the United States, running 504 miles from the Laredo border crossing to the Oklahoma state line.

### Mile-by-Mile Breakdown

**Laredo (MM 0-3):** The [World Trade Bridge](/states/trucking-insurance-texas/border-crossings/) processes 6,000+ trucks daily. Expect 30-90 minutes in standard lanes.

**Laredo to San Antonio (MM 0-154):** The Devine weigh station is one of the busiest in Texas. Long rural stretches with limited services.

**San Antonio (MM 154-163):** Massive I-35 expansion construction through 2030. Use I-410 or Loop 1604 to bypass.

**San Antonio to Austin (MM 163-230):** [SH-130 bypass](/states/trucking-insurance-texas/toll-roads/) starts near New Braunfels. Take it.

**Austin (MM 230-255):** The 4.5B Capital Express Central project is actively disruptive through 2028+. I-35 through Austin is free-flowing only 18 percent of the time.

**Hillsboro to Waco (MM 280-340):** Flooding zone. I-35 floods 2-3 times per year during spring storms. Budget 4 extra hours.

**DFW (MM 400-460):** I-35 splits into I-35E (Dallas) and I-35W (Fort Worth). Use I-635 or I-820 to bypass the metro core.

### I-35 Weigh Stations

| Location | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Devine | ~120 | Both | One of busiest in TX |
| New Braunfels | ~189 | Both | Near SH-130 junction |
| Hillsboro | ~288 | Both | Flood-prone area |
| Denton | ~475 | Both | Near OK border |

## I-10: The Long Haul (880 Miles)

I-10 across Texas is the longest interstate segment in any single state -- 880 miles from the [Louisiana](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/) border to El Paso.

**Louisiana Border to Houston (MM 880-770):** Beaumont and Port Arthur refineries generate heavy tanker traffic. Watch for fog on the Neches River Bridge.

**Houston (MM 770-740):** The Katy Freeway is the widest freeway in the world and still congested at all hours. Use Beltway 8 to bypass. [Houston tolls](/states/trucking-insurance-texas/toll-roads/) require an electronic tag.

**Houston to Junction (MM 740-460):** Hill Country. October through January brings deer crossings -- more wrecks here from animal strikes than any other Texas corridor.

**Junction to Fort Stockton (MM 460-260):** Fuel desert. 200 miles with limited services. Stock fuel before Junction. Cell coverage is spotty to nonexistent.

**Fort Stockton to Van Horn (MM 260-140):** High wind warnings are frequent. Empty trailers tip in this corridor.

**Van Horn to El Paso (MM 140-0):** Mountain grades. Sierra Blanca (MM ~85) has a combined weigh station and Border Patrol checkpoint -- expect double delays.

### I-10 Cell Dead Zones

| Segment | Approximate Miles | Workaround |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Fort Stockton to El Paso | MM 260-0 | Download offline maps, carry satellite communicator |
| Junction to Sonora | MM 460-400 | Limited coverage, plan fuel stops accordingly |

## I-20: Permian Basin Country (635 Miles)

I-20 crosses Texas from [Louisiana](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/) to [New Mexico](/states/trucking-insurance-new-mexico/), passing through the most active oilfield in the Western Hemisphere.

**East Texas to Dallas (MM 635-450):** Moderate traffic. Pine forests and rolling terrain.

**Abilene to Midland-Odessa (MM 280-130):** Entering oil country. Truck traffic increases dramatically. Oilfield vehicles do not always follow traffic laws.

**West of Odessa to NM (MM 110-0):** Sparse services. The Penwell weigh station handles both directions.

## I-45: Houston to Dallas (285 Miles)

The busiest intra-Texas corridor connecting the two largest cities. New Waverly weigh station is active between Houston and Huntsville.

:::tip
During hurricane season (June-November), I-45 can be commandeered for evacuation. All lanes become one-way outbound from Houston. Monitor [DriveTexas.org](https://www.drivetexas.org) during tropical weather.

## I-40: The Panhandle (177 Miles)

The shortest Texas interstate segment crosses the Panhandle from [New Mexico](/states/trucking-insurance-new-mexico/) to [Oklahoma](/states/trucking-insurance-oklahoma/). Ice storms and blizzards November through March. High wind warnings are frequent year-round. The Shamrock weigh station near the Oklahoma border is the last checkpoint.

## Major Weigh Station Summary

| Interstate | Station | Mile Marker | Known For |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| I-35 | Devine | ~120 | Busiest in TX, border traffic |
| I-10 | Sierra Blanca | ~85 | Double checkpoint |
| I-20 | Penwell | ~105 | Permian Basin traffic |
| I-45 | New Waverly | ~95 | Houston-Dallas corridor |
| I-40 | Shamrock | ~165 | OK border checkpoint |

Texas deploys 406 CVE troopers, 225 NAS-certified Highway Patrol troopers, and 144 civilian inspectors. Drivewyze covers the 6 busiest stations plus 51 fixed and 17 mobile sites at 15.75 per vehicle per month. PrePass is also available.

| Mar-Jun | I-35 (Hillsboro-Waco) | Flash flooding |
| Year-round | I-10 (Fort Stockton-Van Horn) | High wind, tipping hazard |
| Oct-Jan | I-10 (Hill Country) | Deer crossings |
