## The Problem

75% of truck drivers in Washington report trouble finding safe parking at least once per week. Only about 530 rest area spaces exist statewide -- far below demand.

## Real-Time Parking Data

WSDOT provides real-time truck parking availability at select I-5 locations with predictive availability up to 4 hours in advance:

| Location | Route | Data Available |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Smokey Point | I-5 | Real-time + predictive |
| Gee Creek | I-5 | Real-time + predictive |
| Fort Lewis (MP 117) | I-5 | Real-time + predictive |
| SeaTac (MP 140) | I-5 | Real-time + predictive |

WSDOT is expanding real-time data to additional locations in 2026. Washington DOT has confirmed API access for dynamic parking data.

## I-5 Parking Options

- **Gee Creek:** Near Oregon border. Often full by evening.
- **Fort Lewis:** Military area. Limited but available.
- **Harbor Island:** Overnight parking near Port of Seattle. Best for drayage operators.
- **Smokey Point:** Near Arlington. Good I-5 midpoint.

## I-90 Parking Options

- **Ellensburg:** Several truck stops at the eastern end of the [Snoqualmie chain zone](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/snoqualmie-pass/)
- **Liberty Lake (MP 297):** Near Idaho border

## WSDOT Expansion Plans

WSDOT is evaluating expansion at 24 rest areas and 18 inspection sites. NWSA publishes truck parking facility maps for I-5 and I-90/I-82/I-182 corridors.

## Planning Tips

- Plan HOS to stop at known locations, not wherever you run out of hours
- Check WSDOT real-time data before committing to a stop
- Use predictive availability (up to 4 hours ahead) to decide early
- Compare with [Nevada truck parking crisis](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/truck-parking/) -- both states face severe shortages
