## The 69-Mile Chain Zone

Snoqualmie Pass on I-90 has the longest chain zone in Washington state: 69 continuous miles from North Bend (MP 32) to Ellensburg (MP 101). When chain requirements are posted, every commercial vehicle over 10,000 lbs must have chains installed. The fine for non-compliance is $500 -- one of the highest in the West.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Chain Zone Start | MP 32 (North Bend) |
| Chain Zone End | MP 101 (Ellensburg) |
| Summit Elevation | 3,022 ft |
| Fine | $500 |
| Oversize Loads | PROHIBITED during chain conditions |

## Key Enforcement Points

Washington State Patrol actively checks vehicles at the **North Bend base** near the eastern chain zone entry. Expect enforcement checks during any active chain requirement. WSP does not give warnings -- they give $500 tickets.

## Chain-Up Areas

WSDOT maintains designated chain-up areas along the corridor. Pull off at designated areas only -- stopping on the highway to chain up is dangerous and can result in additional citations.

## Important Rules

- **Studded tires do NOT count as chains.** You must carry and install actual chains even if you have studded tires.
- **Studded tire season:** November 1 through March 31
- **Chain placement:** At least two front OR two rear tires
- **Oversize loads:** Completely prohibited during chain conditions. Plan alternative timing.

## Alternative Mountain Passes

If Snoqualmie is closed or conditions are severe, these alternatives exist but all have their own challenges:

| Pass | Route | Elevation | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Stevens Pass | US-2 | 4,061 ft | Higher elevation, steeper grades |
| White Pass | US-12 | 4,500 ft | Highest in Washington, most remote |
| Blewett Pass | US-97 | 4,064 ft | North-south route, steep |

All alternative passes have chain requirements when conditions warrant. There is no chain-free route across the Cascades in winter.

## Real-Time Conditions

Washington does NOT use the 511 system. Use WSDOT resources instead:

- **WSDOT Mountain Pass Report:** wsdot.com/travel/real-time/mountainpasses/Snoqualmie
- **WSDOT Travel Alerts:** Sign up for email/text notifications
- **WSDOT App:** Real-time camera feeds and conditions

Washington DOT has confirmed API access for dynamic road condition data.

## Connecting Corridors

- **Eastbound from Snoqualmie:** I-90 continues through Ellensburg and Spokane to the [Idaho panhandle](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/), where Lookout Pass and Fourth of July Pass have their own chain requirements.
- **Westbound:** I-90 descends into Seattle metro where [lane restrictions and port access](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/seattle-tacoma/) apply.
- **[Oregon chain comparison](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/chain-laws/):** Oregon activates statewide; Washington focuses on specific passes but with higher fines.
