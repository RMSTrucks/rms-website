## Every Road Is a Mountain Road

West Virginia is the only state where every interstate involves significant grades, curves, and elevation changes. There is no flat terrain anywhere. The Appalachian Mountains run through the entire state, and every corridor -- I-77, I-79, I-64, I-68 -- is a mountain driving challenge.

## I-77: Virginia to Ohio

### The Fancy Gap Descent (Virginia Approach)

The I-77 approach from Virginia through Fancy Gap is one of the most dangerous truck sections in the eastern United States.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Grade | Up to 6%% in sections |
| Runaway truck ramps | 3 ramps on the descent |
| Construction history | 18 million cubic yards of rock excavated in the first 6 miles |
| East River Mountain Tunnel | Certain hazmat classes may be restricted |

:::tip
Check your brakes BEFORE starting the Fancy Gap descent. Brake check areas exist before the grade begins. Use engine braking (jake brake) aggressively on the way down. Know where the three runaway truck ramps are -- they are not optional knowledge.

### I-77 Through West Virginia

| Segment | Mile Markers | Terrain | Key Features |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Bluefield to Princeton | MM 0-9 | Mountain | East River Mountain Tunnel approach |
| WV Turnpike section | MM 9-69 | Mountain grades throughout | Three toll plazas (Ghent, Pax, Chelyan) |
| Beckley | MM 44 | Mountain | I-64 junction, major interchange |
| Charleston | MM 100 | River valley | I-64 and I-79 junction, urban traffic |
| North of Charleston | MM 100-176 | Mountain/valley | Mineral Wells weigh station SB |
| Parkersburg to Ohio | MM 176-186 | Valley | Ohio River crossing |

## I-79: Charleston to Pennsylvania

I-79 runs 160 miles from Charleston to the Pennsylvania border, climbing and descending through mountain terrain the entire way.

| Segment | Mile Markers | Characteristics |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Charleston to Flatwoods | MM 0-67 | Elk River valley, mountain terrain |
| Flatwoods to Weston | MM 67-99 | Repeated climbs and descents, tight curves |
| Weston to Fairmont | MM 99-137 | Fairmont weigh stations NB/SB |
| Fairmont to Morgantown | MM 137-152 | WVU game day traffic in fall Saturdays |
| Morgantown to PA | MM 152-160 | I-68 junction to Maryland |

The Flatwoods to Weston section is the most technical stretch of I-79. The highway climbs and descends repeatedly through tight curves cut into mountain ridges. Engine braking is essential.

## I-64: Virginia to Kentucky

| Segment | Mile Markers | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| White Sulphur Springs | MM 175 | Mountain terrain, Greenbrier resort area |
| Lewisburg to Beckley | MM 161-44 | Steep grades, tight curves -- real mountain driving |
| Beckley to Charleston | MM 44-0 | Kanawha River valley descent |
| Hurricane weigh station | EB, near Charleston | Enforcement point |
| Charleston to Huntington | West of Charleston | Ohio River valley, industrial corridor |

The Lewisburg to Beckley section is where I-64 earns its reputation. Steep grades, tight curves, and limited sight distance make this one of the most demanding sections of interstate in the eastern US.

## Brake Management

Brakes are the single most important safety factor in West Virginia trucking. Mountain grades consume brakes faster than flat-terrain drivers expect.

### Brake Check Protocol

| When | Where | What to Check |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Before entering WV from Virginia (I-77) | Fancy Gap brake check area | Full inspection -- pad thickness, adjustment, air pressure |
| Before entering WV from Ohio (I-77) | Parkersburg area | Service brakes, parking brake, air system |
| Before Beckley to Charleston descent (I-64) | Beckley area | Re-check after climbing grades from Virginia |
| Before any WV mountain section | Nearest safe pull-off | Brake temperature -- cool brakes before long descent |

### Engine Braking (Jake Brakes)

Engine braking is essential on WV grades. Use it as your primary speed control on descents, supplementing with service brakes only as needed. Some WV communities restrict jake brake use, particularly at night. Watch for No Engine Braking signs near towns.

### Runaway Truck Ramps

| Corridor | Ramp Locations |
|----------|---------------|
| I-77 (Fancy Gap) | 3 ramps on southbound descent |
| I-64 | Located on steep grade sections |
| WV Turnpike | Located along mountain grade sections |

If your brakes are fading, use the ramp. The cost of a ramp recovery is nothing compared to the cost of a runaway truck at the bottom of a mountain.

## Fog

River valley fog can reduce visibility to near zero. It forms in specific locations:

| Valley | Rivers | Worst Conditions |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Kanawha Valley | Kanawha River (Charleston area) | Fall/winter mornings, 5-9 AM |
| Ohio River Valley | Ohio River (Parkersburg/Huntington) | Fall/winter mornings |
| New River Gorge | New River | Year-round early mornings |
| Greenbrier Valley | Greenbrier River (Lewisburg area) | Fall mornings |

The transition from clear to fog can happen in seconds as you descend into a valley.

## Winter Conditions

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Annual snowfall | 40-60 inches at higher elevations |
| Ice storms | November through March |
| Most exposed | Elevations above 3,000 feet |
| Studded tires | Permitted November 1 through April 15 |
| Chains | Permitted but not required |
| Snow emergencies | Local ordinances can ticket vehicles lacking traction |

Chains are not legally required in West Virginia, but carrying them is strongly recommended for winter travel on mountain grades.

## Time Estimates

GPS-based arrival estimates for West Virginia routes are unreliable. Budget additional time:

| Condition | Time Adjustment |
|-----------|----------------|
| Normal conditions | +20-30%% over GPS estimate |
| Winter weather | +50%% or more |
| Fog | Impossible to estimate -- may need to park |
| Construction zones | +30-40%% |

## Cell Coverage

Mountain terrain blocks cell signals throughout West Virginia:

| Corridor | Dead Zones |
|----------|-----------|
| I-77 | Princeton to Beckley |
| I-64 | Virginia border to Beckley |
| I-79 | Flatwoods to Weston (intermittent) |
| I-68 | Eastern sections near Maryland |
