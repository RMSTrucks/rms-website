## Toll Road Overview

The Indiana Toll Road (I-80/90) runs 157 miles across northern Indiana, connecting the Ohio Turnpike at the eastern state line to the Chicago Skyway at the western end. It is operated by the Indiana Toll Road Concession Company (ITRCC) under a long-term concession agreement.

## 2025 Toll Rates

Rates adjust annually on July 1. The following rates are effective as of July 2025.

### Class 5 (5-Axle) Commercial Vehicle

| Trip | E-ZPass | Cash |
|------|---------|------|
| Full crossing (157 mi) | ~$87.49 | Higher |

The Indiana Toll Road is the most expensive toll road per mile in the region for commercial vehicles. E-ZPass and I-PASS transponders are both accepted.

### Rate Comparison: Regional Toll Roads

| Toll Road | Distance | 5-Axle E-ZPass | Per Mile |
|-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
| Indiana Toll Road | 157 mi | ~$87.49 | ~$0.557 |
| Ohio Turnpike (WB) | 241 mi | $58.75 | ~$0.244 |
| Chicago Skyway | 7.8 mi | $45.40 peak | ~$5.82 |

The Skyway has the highest per-mile cost, but the Indiana Toll Road's total trip cost is the highest in the region for a single crossing.

## E-ZPass and I-PASS

- Both E-ZPass and I-PASS transponders are accepted
- E-ZPass is available from toll authorities in 19 states
- I-PASS from the Illinois Tollway is fully compatible
- Cash is accepted but slower and more expensive

## Connecting Corridors

The Indiana Toll Road is the middle link in the I-80 transcontinental corridor:

- **East:** Connects to the [Ohio Turnpike](/states/trucking-insurance-ohio/turnpike/) at the state line
- **West:** Connects to the [Chicago Skyway](/states/trucking-insurance-illinois/tolls/) and Illinois Tollway system

A 5-axle truck running the full I-80 from Ohio through Indiana to Chicago faces:
- Ohio Turnpike: $58.75 (WB, E-ZPass)
- Indiana Toll Road: ~$87.49 (E-ZPass)
- Chicago Skyway: $45.40 (peak)
- **Total: ~$191.64** for a single eastbound-to-westbound crossing

## Service Plazas

The Indiana Toll Road operates service plazas along the route with fuel, food, and restrooms. Truck parking at service plazas is limited -- plan fuel stops but do not rely on plazas for overnight parking.

## Northern Indiana Lake-Effect

The I-80/90 corridor through northern Indiana is subject to lake-effect snow from Lake Michigan, particularly in the Gary, Michigan City, and South Bend areas. Winter conditions can deteriorate rapidly. The Chesterton/Michigan City weigh stations (I-94 EB/WB) are located in this zone.
