## New Mexico Is Not Flat

Truckers expecting flat desert are surprised by New Mexico's elevation. Much of the state sits above 5,000 feet, and the major Interstate corridors cross genuine mountain passes. Raton Pass on I-25 tops 7,834 feet. The Continental Divide on I-40 reaches 7,275 feet. These are real mountain driving challenges with winter conditions that shut down highways.

The state does not have a mandatory chain law, but chains are permitted and carrying them is strongly recommended for winter crossings of Raton Pass and I-40 west of Albuquerque.

## Mountain Pass Reference

| Pass | Interstate/Route | Elevation | Primary Hazard | Winter Risk |
|------|-----------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Raton Pass | I-25 (CO/NM border) | 7,834 ft | Steep grades, switchbacks, winter storms | HIGH |
| Continental Divide | I-40 (MM 47, Grants-Gallup) | 7,275 ft | Snow, wind, high elevation | HIGH |
| Tijeras Canyon | I-40 (east of Albuquerque) | 6,500 ft | Narrow canyon, ice storms | HIGH |
| La Bajada Hill | I-25 (south of Santa Fe) | ~6,000 ft | Steep grade, quick icing | MODERATE |
| I-40 West (Gallup area) | I-40 | 6,000-7,000 ft | Snowfall, ice, closures | HIGH |

## Raton Pass (I-25)

Raton Pass is the highest point on I-25, straddling the Colorado-New Mexico border at 7,834 feet. This is the same pass that challenges Colorado truckers heading south, and it is the most demanding mountain segment on any New Mexico Interstate.

### What Makes Raton Difficult

- **Elevation:** 7,834 feet -- oxygen is thinner, engines work harder
- **Steep grades:** Both approaches have sustained grades that require gear management
- **Switchbacks:** The road curves through mountain terrain, limiting sight distance
- **Winter weather:** Severe conditions from November through April, including heavy snow, ice, and whiteout visibility
- **Wind:** High-altitude wind gusts can push trailers on exposed sections

### Winter Planning

Budget extra time for Raton Pass from November through April. When conditions deteriorate, NMDOT will close the pass entirely. Check road conditions before departing:

- **nmroads.com** -- Official road conditions
- **800-432-4269** -- Phone hotline for road conditions
- **511** -- Abbreviated road condition number

:::tip
Chains are permitted but not legally mandated in New Mexico. For Raton Pass in winter, carry chains anyway. If conditions deteriorate while you are on the pass, having chains can be the difference between making it through and waiting for a tow.

### Connection to Colorado

Raton Pass connects directly to [Colorado's I-25 corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-colorado/). Colorado does have a mandatory traction law system. Be prepared for different chain requirements when crossing the state line.

## Tijeras Canyon (I-40)

Tijeras Canyon carries I-40 through narrow terrain immediately east of Albuquerque at approximately 6,500 feet. This is New Mexico's busiest freight corridor, and it is the canyon segment most likely to close during winter storms.

### The Problem

Tijeras is a canyon -- narrow, with limited shoulder space and no room for error. When ice storms hit (and they hit regularly in winter), the combination of speed, narrow lanes, and black ice creates multi-vehicle pileups. I-40 through Tijeras has some of the highest closure rates of any New Mexico corridor during winter.

### Practical Details

- **Elevation:** ~6,500 feet
- **Location:** I-40 east of Albuquerque, east of the "Big I" interchange with I-25
- **Primary hazard:** Winter ice storms on critical freight corridor
- **When dangerous:** November through March, particularly during overnight temperature drops
- **Alternative:** None practical -- I-40 through Tijeras is the only efficient east-west corridor through central NM

## Continental Divide (I-40)

I-40 crosses the Continental Divide at Mile Marker 47 between Grants and Gallup at 7,275 feet. This is the geographic spine of North America, and the elevation brings genuine winter weather.

### What to Expect

- **Elevation:** 7,275 feet at the divide
- **Approach:** Gradual climbs from both east (Grants) and west (Gallup)
- **Winter conditions:** Heavy snowfall, wind-driven drifts, reduced visibility
- **I-40 closures:** The Gallup-to-Grants stretch closes during major winter storms
- **Services:** Limited between Grants and Gallup -- fuel up before this segment

### Navajo Nation

West of the Continental Divide, I-40 passes through Navajo Nation lands between Gallup and the Arizona border. Services are limited. Winter closures are common. This stretch connects to [Arizona's I-40 corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/) at the state line.

## La Bajada Hill (I-25)

La Bajada Hill on I-25 south of Santa Fe is a steep grade that ices over quickly. It does not get the attention that Raton Pass receives, but it catches truckers who are not expecting a significant grade change between Albuquerque and Santa Fe.

- **Location:** I-25 between Albuquerque and Santa Fe
- **Grade:** Steep descent/ascent
- **Primary hazard:** Quick icing, especially overnight in winter
- **Traffic:** Moderate -- ABQ to Santa Fe commuter traffic

## I-40 West of Albuquerque

The entire I-40 corridor from Albuquerque west through Grants, the Continental Divide, Gallup, and the Arizona border runs at 6,000-7,000+ feet elevation. This 160-mile stretch sees significant snowfall and ice during winter.

### Closure Frequency

I-40 through Gallup closes more frequently than most truckers expect. During major winter storms, the stretch from Grants to the Arizona border can close for hours or even a full day. When this happens, truck parking fills quickly, and options are limited.

### Fuel Planning

- **Albuquerque:** Full services, last major metro heading west
- **Grants:** Fuel available, moderate services
- **Gallup:** Fuel and truck stops available, last NM services before AZ
- **Between Grants and Gallup:** Limited options

## Road Condition Resources

| Resource | Access |

| NMDOT social media | Check for real-time closures |

Check conditions before every winter crossing. Conditions at 7,000+ feet change faster than forecasts can predict. The [weight-distance tax](/states/trucking-insurance-new-mexico/weight-distance-tax/) applies on every mile you drive in NM, including the slow miles crawling over Raton Pass -- plan your costs accordingly.
