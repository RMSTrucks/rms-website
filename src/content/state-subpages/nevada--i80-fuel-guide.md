## The Crossing: 410 Miles of Desert

I-80 across Nevada runs 410 miles from Reno to Wendover at the Utah border. Unlike [Arizona I-10](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/corridors/) where fuel stops are regular, Nevada I-80 demands fuel planning. The interstate itself has reliable stops every 50-70 miles, but the secondary routes that branch off -- US-93, US-95 -- can stretch 100+ miles between services. The rule is simple: keep your tank above half at all times.

## Mile-by-Mile Service Stops

| Location | Approx MP | Distance to Next | Fuel | Food | Showers | Parking |
|----------|-----------|------------------|------|------|---------|--------|
| Reno/Sparks | MP 0-20 | 28 mi to Fernley | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Fernley | MP 48 | 59 mi to Lovelock | Yes | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Lovelock | MP 107 | 71 mi to Winnemucca | Yes | Yes | No | Limited |
| Winnemucca | MP 178 | 51 mi to Battle Mtn | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Battle Mountain | MP 229 | 74 mi to Elko | Yes | Yes | Limited | Limited |
| Elko | MP 303 | 49 mi to Wells | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| Wendover | MP 410 | UT border | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Critical Hubs

### Winnemucca (MP 178)

Winnemucca is the critical midpoint hub on I-80. It sits at the junction with US-95, which runs north to Oregon and south toward Las Vegas. Every major truck stop chain has a presence here. If you are going to top off anywhere on the crossing, Winnemucca is the place. Drivers heading south on US-95 should fill up here -- the next reliable fuel is hours away.

### Elko (MP 303)

Elko is the eastern anchor for I-80 services. Major truck stops, repair facilities, and full-service fuel islands. After Elko, the stops thin out. Wells has fuel but limited amenities, and the 58-mile stretch from Wells to Wendover catches drivers who left Elko with a low tank.

## The Fuel Gaps That Catch Drivers

On I-80 itself, no gap exceeds 75 miles. That is manageable for any truck. The real danger comes from two scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Wells to Wendover (58 miles).** This is the last stretch before Utah. Drivers who skipped Wells expecting Wendover fuel sometimes miscalculate. Wendover has fuel, but if you are running on fumes and miss the exit, there is nothing for another 50 miles into Utah.

**Scenario 2: Leaving I-80 onto secondary routes.** US-93 south from Wells toward Ely is 130+ miles with sparse services. US-95 south from Winnemucca is equally barren. These are not I-80. Fill your tank before leaving the interstate.

## Segment-by-Segment Planning

### Reno to Fernley (48 miles)

Leaving Reno eastbound, you pass through the Sparks industrial corridor with multiple fuel options. Pass through the [Washoe Valley wind restriction zone](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/winter-wind/) and the new I-80 widening area with 50 new truck parking spaces. Fernley has a Pilot and independent stops.

### Fernley to Lovelock (59 miles)

Desert straightaway through the Humboldt Sink. No services between these towns. Lovelock has fuel but limited truck parking and no shower facilities at most stops.

### Lovelock to Winnemucca (71 miles)

The longest gap on the western half of the crossing. Flat desert terrain following the Humboldt River. No services between these points. This is where drivers who skipped Lovelock fuel start watching their gauges.

### Winnemucca to Battle Mountain (51 miles)

Shorter segment. Battle Mountain has fuel and food but limited parking and shower options. Cell coverage is generally good through this stretch.

### Battle Mountain to Elko (74 miles)

The longest single gap on the entire Nevada I-80 crossing. Cell coverage can be spotty between these towns. If you are below half a tank at Battle Mountain, fill up.

### Elko to Wells (49 miles)

Shorter segment with reliable conditions. Wells is the last full-service stop before the Utah border. Fuel here regardless of your gauge reading.

### Wells to Wendover (58 miles)

The final push. Wendover straddles the Nevada-Utah line and has truck stops on both sides. This stretch is desolate but manageable if you fueled in Wells.

## Cell Coverage

| Segment | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| Reno to Fernley | Excellent |
| Fernley to Lovelock | Good |
| Lovelock to Winnemucca | Good |
| Winnemucca to Battle Mountain | Good |
| Battle Mountain to Elko | Variable, dead zones |
| Elko to Wells | Good |
| Wells to Wendover | Variable |

## Speed Limits

Nevada has differential speed limits on I-80. Cars: 75-80 mph. Trucks: 65-70 mph depending on the segment. Urban areas around Reno and Sparks drop to 55-65 for all vehicles.

## Insurance Note

Long-distance I-80 crossings involve extended exposure to harsh conditions, sparse services, and variable weather. Under [SB 180](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/insurance-changes/), intrastate carriers need $1M minimum by January 2026. For the I-80 corridor specifically, RMS recommends $1M CSL minimum regardless of state requirements. Call (208) 800-0640 for a Nevada corridor quote.
