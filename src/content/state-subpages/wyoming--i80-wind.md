## Why I-80 Wyoming Is Different

Every trucker has heard the stories. I-80 through Wyoming is where the northern transcontinental route becomes a survival exercise from October through April. The 402-mile corridor runs at 6,000 to 8,000 feet elevation across the southern Wyoming plateau, and the wind is the primary threat -- not snow. Clear skies with 70 mph crosswinds are common. WYDOT closes this stretch 30 to 40 times per winter, and multi-day closures are not unusual.

The crosswind profile of a 53-foot trailer at highway speed in 60 mph gusts is a physics problem that no amount of driving skill can fully solve. High-profile vehicle restrictions kick in before full closure, pulling empty trailers and box trucks under 40,000 GVW off the road while loaded trucks proceed with caution. When full closure happens, it happens fast, and parking fills within minutes.

## Segment-by-Segment Risk Assessment

| Segment | Mile Posts | Elevation | Wind Risk | Key Feature |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Three Sisters | MP 7-34 | 6,800-7,100 ft | HIGH | Chain law area, designated chain areas at both ends |
| Evanston to Green River | MP 3-89 | 6,700-7,000 ft | MODERATE | Little America truck stop at MP 68 |
| Green River to Rock Springs | MP 89-104 | 6,200 ft | MODERATE | Critical refueling zone |
| Rock Springs to Rawlins | MP 104-215 | 6,500-7,000 ft | HIGH | Long open stretch, limited services |
| Elk Mountain area | MP 235-255 | 7,000-7,500 ft | EXTREME | Peak wind exposure zone, most closures originate here |
| Arlington to Laramie | MP 255-313 | 7,000-7,200 ft | HIGH | Known closure segment |
| Laramie to Cheyenne | MP 313-365 | 6,000-7,200 ft | HIGH | Often last segment to reopen after closures |

### The Elk Mountain Problem

The area around Elk Mountain (MP 235-255) is the epicenter of Wyoming I-80 wind events. The terrain funnels wind across the plateau, and gusts here regularly exceed the threshold for safe truck operation. This is where most multi-vehicle pileups occur, where most closures originate, and where the difference between "windy" and "dangerous" disappears in seconds.

## Truck Stop Locations

| Location | Mile Post | Parking | Fuel | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|------|-------|
| Evanston | MP 3-6 | Large | Yes | Near Utah border, multiple options |
| Little America | MP 68 | Very large | Yes | Legendary stop, best parking on corridor |
| Rock Springs | MP 99-104 | Large | Yes | Multiple truck stops, services |
| Rawlins | MP 211-215 | Medium | Yes | Last major stop before Elk Mountain zone |
| Laramie | MP 310-316 | Medium | Yes | University town, several stops |
| Cheyenne | MP 359-365 | Large | Yes | Eastern terminus, multiple options |

:::tip
When a closure is announced, stop immediately at the nearest truck stop. Do not try to make it to the next exit. Parking at Little America, Rock Springs, and Cheyenne fills within 30 minutes of a closure announcement. If you are between stops, pull to a safe shoulder and wait.

## High-Profile Vehicle Restrictions

Wyoming uses high-profile vehicle restrictions as a precursor to full closure. When wind speeds reach threshold levels, WYDOT restricts vehicles under 40,000 GVW -- primarily empty trailers, box trucks, and RVs -- before closing the road to all traffic.

| Status Level | Who Is Affected | What It Means |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| No restrictions | None | Normal operations, stay vigilant |
| High-profile vehicle restriction | Vehicles under 40,000 GVW | Empty trailers, box trucks pulled off. If you are light, get off the road. |
| Full closure | All vehicles | Road closed. Stop immediately. Wait for reopening. |

If you are running light or empty on I-80 in winter, seriously consider routing north via I-90 through Sheridan. The elevation is lower, wind exposure is less severe, and the Sheridan corridor handles winter weather more predictably.

## The I-90 Alternative

I-90 through Sheridan in northern Wyoming runs at lower elevation with less wind exposure than I-80. It adds miles to an east-west transit, but during winter weather events it may be the only corridor that stays open.

| Factor | I-80 | I-90 |
|--------|------|------|
| Elevation | 6,000-8,000 ft | 3,700-5,000 ft |
| Wind severity | Extreme | Moderate |
| Closure frequency | 30-40 per winter | Significantly less |
| Truck stop density | Good | Lower |
| Speed limit (trucks) | 65 mph | 65 mph |

## Survival Gear Checklist

When running I-80 in winter, carry the following in your cab:

- Blankets or sleeping bag rated to -20F
- Food and water for 48 hours
- Flashlight with extra batteries
- Portable phone charger
- Chains (see [Wyoming chain law requirements](/states/trucking-insurance-wyoming/chain-laws/))
- Fuel: keep tank above half at all times in winter

## Before Every Trip

1. Check wyoroad.info for current conditions and closures
2. Download the WYDOT 511 app
3. Check NWS weather forecasts for wind speed predictions
4. If high wind warnings are issued, consider delaying departure
5. If you are light or empty, evaluate I-90 as an alternative

## What Wind Means for Insurance

I-80 wind incidents generate multi-vehicle pileup claims that can involve dozens of vehicles. A whiteout at Elk Mountain that creates a chain-reaction collision across both lanes of traffic produces claims in the millions. Carriers running I-80 with state minimum [Wyoming trucking insurance](/states/trucking-insurance-wyoming/) coverage of $25,000/$50,000/$20,000 are exposed to catastrophic personal liability. We recommend $1,000,000 CSL minimum for any carrier running the I-80 corridor.
