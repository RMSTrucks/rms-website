## Why Northwest Arkansas Matters

Three of the biggest names in American freight have their headquarters within 30 miles of each other in the northwest corner of Arkansas. That concentration creates one of the densest freight corridors in the South-Central US.

| Company | Headquarters | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Walmart | Bentonville | World's largest retailer; distribution network generates massive inbound/outbound freight |
| Tyson Foods | Springdale | Largest US meat processor; refrigerated freight, live poultry, feed shipments |
| J.B. Hunt Transport | Lowell | One of the largest trucking companies in North America; intermodal, dedicated, brokerage |

The Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers-Bentonville metro area is among the fastest-growing in the country. Population growth means more distribution centers, more last-mile delivery, and more truck traffic on corridors that were not built for current volumes.

## Key Routes and Navigation

### I-49 (Primary North-South)

I-49 is the primary freight corridor through NW Arkansas, running from Fort Smith through Fayetteville, Springdale, Rogers, and Bentonville before continuing north into Missouri. This highway carries the heaviest truck traffic in the region due to distribution center access.

:::tip
I-49 through the Fayetteville-Bentonville metro area experiences significant congestion during morning and evening commute hours. If you can schedule deliveries for mid-morning or early afternoon, you will avoid the worst of it.

### US-71/US-71B

US-71 and US-71B serve as alternate north-south routes and access roads to distribution facilities. US-71B runs through downtown areas of Fayetteville, Springdale, and Rogers -- expect lower speed limits, traffic signals, and tight turns for larger rigs.

### I-49 to I-40 Connection

Carriers moving freight between NW Arkansas and the east-west I-40 corridor use I-49 south to Alma/Van Buren, where it connects to I-40. This is a 60-mile run through hilly Ozark terrain that can ice in winter.

## Freight Generators

### Walmart Distribution

Walmart operates multiple distribution centers throughout NW Arkansas and surrounding areas. Key patterns:

- Inbound freight from ports (Los Angeles, Houston, Savannah) moves via I-40 and I-49
- Regional distribution feeds stores across the South-Central US
- Vendor compliance requirements are strict -- delivery windows, documentation, and trailer condition standards
- Walmart OTIF (On-Time In-Full) metrics affect vendor ratings, which pressure carriers to be precise

### Tyson Foods

Tyson Foods generates several distinct freight types:

- **Live poultry:** Contract haulers move birds from farms to processing plants, primarily on rural routes
- **Refrigerated finished product:** Processed meat ships from Springdale facilities to distribution nationwide
- **Feed and grain:** Inbound agricultural commodities supply processing operations
- **Temperature-controlled requirements:** Reefer units must maintain continuous cold chain documentation

### J.B. Hunt

J.B. Hunt is both a shipper (moving its own freight) and a carrier (moving others). Their Lowell headquarters generates:

- Intermodal container drayage to and from rail facilities
- Dedicated fleet operations serving major retail accounts
- Brokerage loads that attract owner-operators to the region
- Driver recruitment -- NW Arkansas is a J.B. Hunt hiring market

## Truck Parking

Truck parking pressure in NW Arkansas has increased with metro growth. Options include:

| Location | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| I-49 truck stops (Rogers/Bentonville) | Commercial | Fill up early evening |
| I-49 truck stops (Springdale/Fayetteville) | Commercial | Moderate availability |
| Alma/Van Buren (I-40/I-49 junction) | Commercial | Better availability, 60 miles south |
| I-40 rest areas | Public | Limited truck spaces |

Demand exceeds supply during peak delivery windows (Monday-Thursday). If parking in the metro area is full, Alma at the I-40/I-49 junction typically has availability.

## Weather Hazards

Northwest Arkansas sits in the Ozark Mountains, and the primary weather hazard is ice -- not snow. Key concerns:

- **Ice storms:** The Ozarks are in the ice storm belt. Freezing rain coats roads and bridges without the visual warning of snow. Bridge icing happens faster than road icing.
- **Fog:** River valleys produce dense fog, especially in the early morning during fall and spring.
- **Spring storms:** Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are possible March through June.
- **Winter timing:** Ice events typically occur December through February, but early November and late March are not unusual.

## Insurance for NW Arkansas Operations

Carriers serving NW Arkansas should consider:

- **Cargo coverage:** Retail and food freight values require adequate cargo limits. Walmart loads can be high-value.
- **Reefer breakdown:** Tyson and food distribution freight requires temperature-controlled coverage.
- **Auto liability:** Metro area congestion and Ozark mountain driving create combined exposure.

Arkansas rates are moderate compared to neighboring states. No tolls anywhere in the state. For a quote on NW Arkansas freight operations, contact RMS at (208) 800-0640.
