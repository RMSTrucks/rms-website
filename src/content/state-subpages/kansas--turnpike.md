## All-Electronic Tolling Since July 2024

The Kansas Turnpike went fully electronic in July 2024. There are no cash lanes, no toll booths to stop at, no attendants. Every vehicle is tolled electronically -- either by transponder or by license plate. If you do not have a compatible transponder, you will be billed by license plate at the highest rate.

## The E-ZPass Warning

**E-ZPass does NOT work on the Kansas Turnpike.** This catches East Coast and Midwest drivers off guard. If you run through Kansas with only an E-ZPass transponder, you will be billed by license plate at double the K-TAG rate.

### Compatible Transponders

| Transponder | Region | Works on KS Turnpike? |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| K-TAG | Kansas | Yes -- best rate |
| PikePass | Oklahoma | Yes |
| TxTag / TollTag | Texas | Yes |
| BestPass | National fleet | Yes |
| PrePass | National fleet | Yes |
| E-ZPass | Eastern US / Midwest | **NO** |
| SunPass | Florida | **NO** |
| Peach Pass | Georgia | **NO** |

If you run the I-35 corridor regularly, get a K-TAG. It pays for itself in two or three trips compared to license plate billing.

## Toll Rates

The Kansas Turnpike runs 236 miles and charges by the mile. Rates for 5-axle commercial vehicles:

| Payment Method | Rate Per Mile | Full Turnpike Cost (236 mi) |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| K-TAG | $0.138 | ~$32.57 |
| License plate (no transponder) | $0.276 | ~$65.14 |

K-TAG saves approximately 50% compared to license plate tolling. For carriers running the Turnpike regularly, the math is simple: get a K-TAG.

### K-TAG Setup

- Order online through the Kansas Turnpike Authority website
- Transponder is free with prepaid account setup
- Minimum prepaid balance required
- Transponder mounts on the windshield
- Account management available online

## Turnpike Route

The Kansas Turnpike primarily follows I-35 from the Oklahoma border (South Haven) through Wichita to the I-70 interchange near Topeka, with a connection via I-335 to I-70 at Junction City.

| Segment | Route | Miles | Key Features |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|
| South Haven to Wichita | I-35 | ~80 | Oklahoma border, South Haven weigh station |
| Wichita to Emporia | I-35 | ~80 | Flint Hills, moderate traffic |
| Emporia to Topeka | I-35 | ~60 | Rolling terrain, connects to I-70 at Topeka |
| I-335 spur | I-335 | ~16 | Connects I-35 to I-70 at Junction City |

## Service Areas

The Turnpike has service plazas spaced along the route with fuel, food, and restrooms. Not all plazas have full truck services. Plan your fuel stops -- running dry on the Turnpike with no exit options is not a situation you want.

## Weigh Station

The South Haven weigh station sits at the southern end of the Turnpike near the Oklahoma border. LCV (Longer Combination Vehicle) carriers with KIA permits may bypass via PrePass at South Haven, but all other oversize/overweight vehicles must enter when the station is open.

## Oklahoma Connection

The Kansas Turnpike connects seamlessly to Oklahoma turnpikes at the South Haven border crossing. If you continue south into Oklahoma:

- PikePass works on both Kansas and Oklahoma turnpikes
- K-TAG works on Oklahoma turnpikes
- Oklahoma also does not accept E-ZPass
- Cash is still accepted on some Oklahoma turnpikes (unlike Kansas)

## Cost Comparison: K-TAG vs No Transponder

For a carrier making regular Kansas Turnpike runs:

| Trips Per Month | K-TAG Annual Cost | License Plate Annual Cost | Annual Savings |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 2 | ~$781 | ~$1,563 | ~$782 |
| 4 | ~$1,563 | ~$3,126 | ~$1,563 |
| 8 | ~$3,126 | ~$6,252 | ~$3,126 |

The savings justify getting a K-TAG after just a couple of trips. There is no reason to pay double.

## Alternatives to the Turnpike

If you want to avoid Turnpike tolls entirely:

- **I-35 free sections:** I-35 north of Topeka to Kansas City is NOT part of the Turnpike and is toll-free
- **US-77:** Parallel north-south route through central Kansas (slower, two-lane sections)
- **US-81:** Another parallel route (Wichita to Salina area)
- **I-70:** East-west travel across Kansas is free on I-70

Note that I-70 through Missouri is also toll-free (Missouri law prohibits tolls). The toll charges apply specifically to the Kansas Turnpike segment.
