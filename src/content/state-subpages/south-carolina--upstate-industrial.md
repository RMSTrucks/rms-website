## The Upstate: South Carolina's Manufacturing Engine

The I-85 corridor between Greenville and Spartanburg is one of the densest manufacturing zones in the Southeast. Anchored by BMW's only North American assembly plant in Greer and Michelin's North American headquarters in Greenville, the Upstate generates heavy truck traffic serving an automotive supply chain that extends across multiple states. This is not port freight -- this is parts-in, vehicles-out, tires, plastics, and precision components moving on tight schedules.

## Key Industrial Facilities

| Facility | Location | Product/Role | Truck Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| BMW Manufacturing | Greer (I-85 Exit 60) | X3, X5, X7 assembly | Inbound parts, outbound vehicles |
| Michelin NA HQ | Greenville | Tire manufacturing and R&D | Raw materials, finished tires |
| Inland Port Greer | Greer | Rail-to-truck intermodal | Container transfers from Charleston |
| Greenville-Spartanburg Int'l Airport | GSP | Air cargo | Time-sensitive freight |
| Multiple Tier 1/Tier 2 suppliers | I-85 corridor | Automotive components | JIT delivery schedules |

The BMW Greer plant is the largest BMW factory in the world by volume, producing over 400,000 vehicles annually. The supply chain for that output creates a constant stream of truck movements -- inbound parts from suppliers across the Southeast and outbound finished vehicles heading to the Port of Charleston for export or to dealer networks.

## Inland Port Greer

SC Ports Authority operates the Inland Port Greer, located at the junction of I-85 and I-26 near Spartanburg. This facility extends the Port of Charleston 212 miles inland by rail (Norfolk Southern), converting containerized cargo from rail to truck for final delivery across the Upstate and beyond.

The Inland Port significantly reduces truck traffic on I-26 between Charleston and the Upstate. For carriers, this means:
- Containers can be picked up in Greer instead of making the 212-mile drive to Charleston
- Gate hours differ from Charleston marine terminals -- check scspa.com
- Standard drayage operations apply (TWIC not required at Inland Port)

## I-85 Through the Upstate

The I-85 corridor runs 106 miles through South Carolina, with the Upstate industrial core concentrated between mile markers 50 and 80.

### Traffic Patterns

| Time | Segment | Conditions |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 6:00 AM - 8:30 AM | I-85 through GSP area | Heavy -- shift changes at plants |
| 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM | I-85 Greenville to Spartanburg | Heavy -- commuter and freight mix |
| 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM | Full corridor | Moderate -- best window for deliveries |
| Weekends | Full corridor | Light |

The I-26/I-85 junction at Spartanburg handles both Upstate manufacturing traffic and [Port of Charleston](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/charleston-port/) drayage traffic moving inland. This interchange is the busiest freight crossroads in the Upstate.

## Southern Connector Toll Road

The Southern Connector (I-185) in the Greenville area is the only toll road in South Carolina. It provides a bypass around southern Greenville.

| Vehicle Class | Palmetto Pass (Electronic) | Cash |
|--------------|---------------------------|------|
| 2-axle | $1.80 | $2.00 |
| 3-axle | $3.60 | $4.00 |
| 4-axle | $5.40 | $6.00 |
| 5+ axle | $7.20 | $8.00 |

For most freight movements, the Southern Connector saves time versus routing through Greenville surface streets. The toll is modest compared to the delay cost of urban routing.

## Greenville and Spartanburg Navigation

### Greenville
Downtown Greenville has undergone significant redevelopment and is not truck-friendly in the core area. Stay on I-85, I-385, and US-25 (White Horse Road) for freight movements. The Laurens Road corridor and Mauldin area have warehouse clusters accessible from I-385.

### Spartanburg
I-26 and I-85 intersect at Spartanburg, creating the primary freight interchange for the eastern Upstate. The US-29 corridor north of Spartanburg serves distribution facilities. BMW plant access is best from I-85 Exit 60.

## Truck Parking

| Location | Spaces | Access |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Pilot Spartanburg (I-85) | ~60 | I-85 Exit 72 |
| TA Greenville (I-85) | 100+ | I-85 Exit 46 |
| Various industrial lots | 15-30 | Along I-85 corridor |

Parking is less constrained than in [Charlotte](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/charlotte-hub/) or [Atlanta](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/atlanta-freight/), but JIT delivery schedules for automotive plants mean timing matters more than parking availability.

## Insurance Considerations for Upstate Operations

Upstate manufacturing supply chain hauling creates specific insurance needs:

- **Cargo values:** Automotive components and finished assemblies can be high-value. [Cargo insurance](/coverage/cargo/) should reflect actual load values.
- **Schedule sensitivity:** JIT operations mean missed deliveries have outsized financial impact. Towing and breakdown coverage reduces downtime risk.
- **Physical damage:** Plant yards and tight dock areas increase equipment damage frequency.

RMS recommends $1,000,000 auto liability for Upstate operations, with cargo coverage matched to the specific commodities hauled. The [SC corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/corridors/) covers weigh stations and routing for the full I-85 corridor.
