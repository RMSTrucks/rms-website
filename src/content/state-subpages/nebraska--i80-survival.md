## 455 Miles: Omaha to Wyoming

I-80 through Nebraska is 455 miles of corridor that gets progressively more remote, more elevated, and more exposed as you head west. The eastern half between Omaha and Kearney is manageable -- good cell coverage, regular services, moderate traffic. The western half from Kearney to Wyoming is where preparation becomes survival. Cell coverage drops out, rest areas hold only 6-12 trucks, fuel gaps stretch long, and winter closures can strand you for days.

## Six Segments

### Segment 1: Omaha to Lincoln (55 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Urban/suburban corridor |
| Traffic | Highest in Nebraska |
| Cell coverage | Excellent |
| Services | Abundant |
| Hazards | Omaha I-80/I-480/I-680 interchange construction |

This is the easy section. Urban congestion in Omaha and Lincoln, but services are everywhere and cell coverage is full strength. The Omaha interchange complex (I-80/I-480/I-680) has ongoing construction -- check 511.nebraska.gov for current lane closures.

### Segment 2: Lincoln to Grand Island (100 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Agricultural heartland, flat |
| Traffic | Moderate |
| Cell coverage | Good |
| Services | York, Aurora, Grand Island |
| Weigh stations | Waverly/Greenwood (EB/WB MP 415, weigh-in-motion) |

The Waverly/Greenwood stations near Lincoln use weigh-in-motion technology. This segment crosses the agricultural heartland with grain truck traffic, especially during harvest season (September-November).

### Segment 3: Grand Island to North Platte (100 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Flat, open prairie |
| Traffic | Light to moderate |
| Cell coverage | Good to spotty (drops west of Kearney) |
| Services | Kearney (major stop), Lexington, Cozad |
| Hazards | Wind exposure increases |

Kearney is the last major service center with reliable cell coverage. West of Kearney, the corridor opens up and the infrastructure thins out. This is where the transition from easy driving to survival driving begins.

### Segment 4: North Platte to Ogallala (55 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Sandhills region, slightly rolling |
| Traffic | Light |
| Cell coverage | **Spotty to weak** |
| Services | North Platte (last major stop), Ogallala |
| Weigh stations | North Platte (EB/WB MP 180.5) |
| Hazards | Wind, reduced cell coverage |

The North Platte stations divide I-80 roughly into thirds. North Platte is the last real service center before western Nebraska. Stock up on fuel, food, and patience here.

### Segment 5: Ogallala to Sidney (60 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | High plains, elevation rising |
| Traffic | Light |
| Cell coverage | **Weak to nonexistent** |
| Services | Ogallala, limited until Sidney |
| Hazards | Wind, cell dead zones, rising elevation |

:::tip
The Ogallala westbound rest area is under reconstruction with an expected completion date of spring 2026 and expanded truck parking. Until construction is complete, westbound parking options between North Platte and Sidney are extremely limited.

### Segment 6: Sidney to Wyoming (85 Miles)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | High plains approaching 4,000+ feet |
| Traffic | Light |
| Cell coverage | **Nonexistent in stretches** |
| Services | Sidney, Kimball, Pine Bluffs (minimal) |
| Hazards | Wind, winter storms, elevation, cell dead zones |

The final 85 miles to Wyoming climb toward 4,000 feet. This is the most exposed section of I-80 in Nebraska. Winter storms hit hardest here, and NDOT closes this section first during severe weather. The Wyoming border at Pine Bluffs drops you into I-80 Wyoming, where conditions can be even more severe.

## Cell Coverage Map

| Segment | Omaha-Lincoln | Lincoln-Grand Island | Grand Island-Kearney | Kearney-North Platte | North Platte-Ogallala | Ogallala-Sidney | Sidney-Wyoming |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Coverage | Full | Good | Good | Spotty | Weak | Nonexistent | Nonexistent |

**Download offline maps before passing Kearney westbound.** If you need to make an emergency call in western Nebraska, look for small towns near exits where tower coverage may be slightly better. A CB radio provides backup communication.

## Fuel and Services Spacing

| Location | I-80 Exit | Fuel | Food | Repair | Parking |
|----------|-----------|------|------|--------|---------|
| Omaha | Multiple | Yes | Yes | Yes | 300+ |
| Lincoln | Multiple | Yes | Yes | Yes | 200+ |
| York | 353 | Yes | Yes | Limited | 50+ |
| Grand Island | 312 | Yes | Yes | Yes | 100+ |
| Kearney | 272 | Yes | Yes | Yes | 100+ |
| Lexington | 237 | Yes | Yes | Limited | 30+ |
| North Platte | 177 | Yes | Yes | Yes | 80+ |
| Ogallala | 126 | Yes | Yes | Limited | 30+ |
| Sidney | 59 | Yes | Yes | Limited | 30+ |
| Kimball | 20 | Yes | Limited | Limited | 10-20 |

The longest fuel gap is between Sidney and Kimball/Pine Bluffs (roughly 40 miles). In western Nebraska, do not pass a fuel stop without topping off if your gauge is below half.

## Rest Area Capacity

Most Nebraska I-80 rest areas were designed for a different era of trucking. Current capacity:

| Reality | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Typical capacity | 6-12 truck spaces per rest area |
| Traffic volume | Tens of thousands of trucks daily |
| Peak overflow | Rest areas fill by mid-afternoon |
| Best strategy | Plan overnight stops at commercial truck stops in service cities |

The Ogallala westbound rest area reconstruction (expected spring 2026) will add capacity to what has been one of the worst parking gaps on the corridor.

## Weigh Stations

| Station | Mile Marker | Direction | Type |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Waverly/Greenwood | MP 415 | EB/WB | Weigh-in-motion |
| North Platte | MP 180.5 | EB/WB | Full station |

Drivewyze and PrePass are available at both locations.

## Elevation Profile

| Location | Approximate Elevation |
|----------|---------------------|
| Omaha | 1,100 ft |
| Lincoln | 1,200 ft |
| Grand Island | 1,850 ft |
| Kearney | 2,150 ft |
| North Platte | 2,800 ft |
| Ogallala | 3,200 ft |
| Sidney | 4,000 ft |
| Pine Bluffs (WY border) | 4,200+ ft |

The elevation gain is gradual but significant -- you climb over 3,000 feet from Omaha to the Wyoming border. Higher elevation means thinner air, slightly reduced engine performance, and dramatically different weather than the eastern plains.
