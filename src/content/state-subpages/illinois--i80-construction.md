## Project Overview

The I-80 Will County rebuild is the largest active highway construction project in Illinois. The $1.2 billion project covers 16 miles from Ridge Road in Minooka to US 30 in Joliet/New Lenox, and it is scheduled for substantial completion by the end of 2028. The corridor carries over 80,000 vehicles per day, with 25 percent of that volume being trucks.

This is a full corridor reconstruction -- not just resurfacing. Bridges, interchanges, ramps, and the roadbed itself are being rebuilt in phases. The I-55/I-80 interchange is being completely redesigned with new flyover ramps.

## Construction Timeline

| Phase | Work | Target Completion |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | I-55 interchange ramp rebuilds | Fall 2025 - Fall 2026 |
| Phase 2 | NB I-55 to WB I-80 ramp | Fall 2025 |
| Phase 3 | SB I-55 to EB I-80 ramp | Fall 2026 |
| Phase 4 | New flyover: SB I-55 to EB I-80 | 2026-2027 |
| Phase 5 | Larkin Ave interchange rebuild | 2025-2027 |
| Final | Substantial completion | End of 2028 |

## Impact on Truckers

### Ramp Closures

Ramp closures rotate throughout the project. At any given time, one or more ramps at the I-55/I-80 interchange may be closed with detour routes posted. The closures change as phases progress, so checking the project website before each trip is essential.

### Detour Routes

When I-80 ramps are closed, detours typically route through:
- US 30 (parallel east-west route south of I-80)
- IL Route 7 (Larkin Avenue corridor)
- I-55 to I-80 via local roads when interchange ramps are down

Detour routes add 15-30 minutes depending on the specific closure and time of day.

### Real-Time Updates

The project website [i80will.org](https://i80will.org) provides:
- Current ramp closure status
- Detour route maps
- Construction schedule updates
- Lane restriction information

Bookmark this site if you run I-80 through Will County with any regularity. Conditions change frequently as phases transition.

## Planning Around the Construction

- **Time of day matters:** Nighttime and early morning windows have less congestion but may have more active construction zones with lane shifts
- **I-55 interchange:** The most impacted section. Budget extra time when I-55/I-80 ramps are affected
- **Alternative corridors:** Consider I-88 (Reagan Memorial Tollway) as an alternative east-west route, though toll costs apply
- **Weigh stations still active:** Frankfort/Tinley Park stations (I-80 MP 143.5 EB / MP 147.5 WB) remain operational through construction

:::tip
Check [i80will.org](https://i80will.org) before every I-80 run through Will County. Ramp closures and lane configurations change frequently, and a 5-minute check can save you 30+ minutes of unexpected delays.
