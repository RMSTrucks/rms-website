## Chicago Municipal Truck Restrictions

Chicago's municipal code creates a layered system of truck restrictions that trips up drivers who are used to simply following their GPS. The city divides its core into zones with different rules, and the penalties for violations are steep.

### Inner Loop District

No freight vehicles are allowed in the Inner Loop unless making deliveries or pickups within the district. This is not a weight-based restriction -- it applies to all commercial freight vehicles regardless of size. If your destination is not inside the loop, stay out.

### Extended Downtown Zone

The area bounded by Michigan Avenue, Harrison Street, Halsted Street, and Chicago Avenue prohibits freight vehicles over 33 feet from 8 AM to 6 PM on weekdays. Deliveries during these hours require vehicles under the length limit or off-hours scheduling.

| Zone | Restriction | Hours | Applies To |
|------|------------|-------|------------|
| Inner Loop | No freight unless delivering within | 24/7 | All freight vehicles |
| Extended Downtown | No vehicles over 33 ft | 8 AM - 6 PM weekdays | Freight vehicles |
| Boulevards | No commercial freight | 24/7 | Unless loading at abutting property |
| Residential streets | No truck/semi parking | 24/7 | All commercial vehicles |
| Business streets | No truck/semi parking | 24/7 | All commercial vehicles |

### Boulevard Ban

Chicago's designated boulevards prohibit all commercial freight vehicles unless you are loading or unloading at a property directly on the boulevard. Even then, you must enter from the nearest cross street -- no cruising down the boulevard looking for your stop.

## Speed Limits and Enforcement

The 6-county truck speed split is the single most ticketed truck violation in the Chicago metro. Trucks over 8,001 lbs are limited to 60 mph in Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will counties while passenger vehicles get 70 mph. Illinois State Police run targeted enforcement on I-90, I-94, and I-294. The fines escalate quickly, and repeated violations can trigger a CSA review.

## O'Hare Freight Access

O'Hare International Airport area freight routing uses I-90 as the primary corridor, with I-294 connecting to I-190 for airport access. Overnight deliveries are recommended to avoid the severe daytime congestion on I-190 and Mannheim Road. The I-294 reconstruction project (Balmoral Avenue to 95th Street) adds construction delays to the western approach.

## Key Interchanges to Know

- **I-90/I-94 merge (Dan Ryan):** One of the worst interchanges in the nation. Expect stop-and-go during rush hours and frequent incidents.
- **Circle Interchange (I-90/94 + I-290):** Notorious bottleneck. If you can avoid it, use I-294 around the metro instead.
- **I-80/I-55/I-57 interchange:** Under reconstruction through 2028 as part of the Will County rebuild. Check [i80will.org](https://i80will.org) for current ramp status.
- **I-294/I-90 junction:** Construction active. Allow extra time.

## CMAP Designated Truck Routes

The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) maintains the official designated truck route map for the metro area. Trucks exceeding 8 ft width must use designated routes unless making local deliveries. The CMAP map is available online and should be bookmarked by any driver delivering into the metro regularly. Non-designated routes have an 8 ft width limit compared to 8.5 ft on designated routes.

Bookmark the CMAP truck route map and cross-reference it with your delivery addresses before accepting loads into Chicago. The municipal code restrictions are complex, but they are consistently enforced.
