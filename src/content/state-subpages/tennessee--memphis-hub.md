## FedEx World Hub and Memphis Freight

Memphis International Airport is the largest cargo airport in North America, primarily because of the FedEx World Hub. FedEx sorts over 2 million packages per day at this facility, and the ground transportation network feeding the hub generates massive truck traffic concentrated in the southeast quadrant of the Memphis metro.

The FedEx effect ripples outward. Distribution centers, warehouses, and logistics providers cluster around the airport and along the I-40/I-55/I-240 interchange system. If you haul freight in the Southeast, Memphis is either a destination or a crossroads.

## Routing Through Memphis

### Interstate Network

| Interstate | Memphis Segment | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| I-40 | MM 0-25 | East-west through north Memphis, Mississippi River crossing to Arkansas |
| I-55 | North-south | Mississippi River crossing to West Memphis AR, connects to I-240 |
| I-240 | Loop | Inner loop around Memphis, connects all interstates |
| I-269 | Outer bypass | Newer bypass east and south of Memphis -- less congested |

### Bypass Strategy

If you are through-traffic and do not need to deliver in Memphis, I-269 is the bypass. It loops east and south of the metro area, connecting I-40 East to I-55 South without entering the congested I-240 loop. The trade-off is additional miles, but the time savings during peak hours makes it worthwhile.

### Peak Congestion

| Time | Direction | Severity |
|------|-----------|----------|
| 6:30 AM - 9:00 AM | I-40 EB, I-240 all | Heavy |
| 3:30 PM - 6:30 PM | I-40 WB, I-240 all | Heavy |
| 10:00 PM - 4:00 AM | FedEx hub area | Moderate (FedEx sort operations) |

The FedEx sort window creates a unique nighttime traffic pattern. Trucks feeding the hub converge between 10 PM and 2 AM, creating congestion that most cities do not experience at those hours.

## Truck Parking

Memphis has a severe truck parking shortage, particularly near the FedEx hub. Options:

| Location | Approx. Spaces | Distance to FedEx Hub | Amenities |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Flying J (I-55 Exits 3-8) | 190 | 15 mi | Full service |
| TA (I-55) | 177 | 12 mi | Full service |
| Petro (I-55) | 218 | 14 mi | Full service |
| Various lots near airport | 20-50 each | 2-5 mi | Basic |

Overnight parking demand near the FedEx hub significantly exceeds supply. Arrive before 6 PM to secure a space, or use the larger truck stops along I-55 and plan your hub approach timing.

## Distribution Center Clusters

- **Southeast Memphis / Airport Area:** FedEx hub, Amazon, multiple 3PLs
- **Olive Branch, MS (south):** Growing warehouse district just across the state line
- **West Memphis, AR (across river):** Lower-cost warehouse space, I-40 access
- **Millington (north):** Industrial park with rail connections

## Connecting Corridors

Memphis sits at the junction of I-40 (coast-to-coast) and I-55 (Chicago to New Orleans). The [Arkansas I-40 corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-arkansas/) continues west across the Mississippi River. I-55 connects south toward [Louisiana](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/) through the Mississippi Delta. The [Tennessee corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/corridors/) covers the full I-40 route across the state from Memphis to the Smokies.
