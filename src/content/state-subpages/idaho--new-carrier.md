## Interstate vs. Intrastate: Know Which Path You Need

The requirements depend on whether you will operate across state lines (interstate) or only within Idaho (intrastate).

| Requirement | Interstate | Intrastate |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| USDOT Number | Through FMCSA | Through Idaho State Police |
| MC Number | Yes (for-hire) | No |
| BOC-3 | Yes | No |
| Insurance Filing | BMC-91/91X with FMCSA | Form E with Motor Carrier Services |
| Liability Minimum | $750,000 federal | $25,000/$50,000/$15,000 state |
| UCR | Yes | No |
| IFTA | Yes | No |
| IRP | Yes | No |

## Step-by-Step: Interstate Authority

### Step 1: USDOT Number
Apply through FMCSA at safer.fmcsa.dot.gov. Free. Processing takes 1-2 business days.

### Step 2: MC Number
Apply through FMCSA. $300 filing fee. Takes 3-4 weeks for full approval.

### Step 3: BOC-3 (Process Agent)
Designate a process agent in each state where you operate. Blanket filings cost $30-50.

### Step 4: Insurance Filing (BMC-91/91X)
Your insurance company files form BMC-91 or BMC-91X with FMCSA.

- **Minimum:** $750,000 for general freight
- **Recommended:** $1,000,000 CSL -- most brokers require it
- Call RMS at (208) 800-0640 for a new authority quote

### Step 5: UCR, IFTA, IRP
- **UCR:** Annual registration at ucr.gov
- **IFTA:** Apply through Idaho State Tax Commission
- **IRP:** Apply through Idaho DMV

## Step-by-Step: Intrastate Authority

### Step 1: USDOT Through Idaho State Police
This is the key difference -- intrastate USDOT numbers in Idaho come through Idaho State Police, NOT FMCSA. Contact Motor Carrier Services: 208-334-8611.

### Step 2: Form E Insurance Filing
Your insurance company files Form E with Idaho Motor Carrier Services.

- **State minimums:** $25,000/$50,000/$15,000
- **Recommended:** $1,000,000 CSL -- state minimums are a trap. One accident on [I-90 in winter](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/) will blow through $50,000 in seconds.

### Step 3: Vehicle Registration
Register vehicles with ITD. Vehicles over 10,000 lbs in Idaho overnight for business need temporary registration.

## Idaho-Specific Tips for New Carriers

- Idaho is one of the lowest-cost states to base a trucking operation. No toll roads, no weight-mile tax.
- The [color-coded weight system](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/permits-weight/) lets you run heavier loads on designated routes.
- Pacific NW owner-operators often establish business in Idaho for cost advantages while running loads into Oregon and Washington.
- Shop your insurance at 12 months. First-year premiums are always higher. RMS specializes in finding competitive rates for carriers with clean first-year records.
