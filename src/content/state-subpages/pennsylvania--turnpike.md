## 2026 Toll Rates

The PA Turnpike raised rates 4% effective January 4, 2026 -- the lowest annual increase since 2014. The per-mile rate for commercial vehicles is $0.073, plus a $1.13 segment fee at each interchange.

| Vehicle Class | Axles | Typical Toll (E-ZPass) | Toll By Plate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Class 1 | 2 (passenger) | $6.40 | $12.80 |
| Class 2 | 2 (small truck) | $12.70 | $25.40 |
| Class 3 | 3 | $15.30 | $30.60 |
| Class 4 | 4 | $19.70 | $39.40 |
| Class 5 | 5 | $24.12 | $48.24 |
| Class 6 | 6 | $27.50 | $55.00 |
| Class 7-9 | 7+ | $31.80+ | $61.60+ |

A full-length crossing from Philadelphia (I-276/I-95 interchange) to Pittsburgh (I-376/I-76) costs $100+ for a Class 5 truck with E-ZPass. Without E-ZPass, that same trip runs $200+ via Toll By Plate. E-ZPass saves roughly 50% on every toll.

### E-ZPass Account Options

**Pre-paid accounts** work for most carriers -- load a balance and tolls deduct automatically. **Post-paid business accounts** are available for operations spending $5,000+ per year but require a surety bond. E-ZPass transponders work across 19+ states including all Northeast states, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.

## The Five Tunnels

The PA Turnpike passes through five tunnels on the mainline and NE Extension. Each tunnel bans specific hazmat classes.

| Tunnel | Location | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Allegheny Mountain | Milepost 131-133 | 1.2 miles |
| Tuscarora Mountain | Milepost 151-153 | 1.1 miles |
| Kittatinny Mountain | Milepost 172-173 | 0.9 miles |
| Blue Mountain | Milepost 186-187 | 0.8 miles |
| Lehigh Tunnel | NE Extension MP A74 | 0.9 miles |

### Hazmat Restrictions

**Completely prohibited in all tunnels:**
- Class 1.1-1.6: Explosives
- Class 2.3: Poison gas
- Class 4.3: Dangerous when wet
- Class 5.2: Organic peroxides
- Class 6.1: Poison/toxic substances
- Class 7: Radioactive

**Prohibited in bulk quantities only:**
- Class 2.1: Flammable gas
- Class 3: Flammable liquids
- Class 4.1: Flammable solids
- Class 4.2: Spontaneously combustible
- Class 5.1: Oxidizers
- Class 6: Poison (general)
- Class 8: Corrosives

The Allegheny Tunnel Realignment project is underway to eliminate the need for maintenance-related diversions. Until complete, expect occasional closures that reroute traffic to the parallel abandoned tunnel bore.

## Oversize/Overweight on the Turnpike

The PA Turnpike requires its own separate OS/OW permit, distinct from PennDOT permits for other state roads. Contact the PA Turnpike Operations Center for permit applications. No OS/OW movement is permitted during Tier 2+ winter restrictions, on Sundays, or on holidays.

## Winter Operations

The PA Turnpike enforces the same 5-tier winter restriction system as all state highways. Speed drops to 45 mph during any active tier. The Allegheny Mountain grades between Somerset and Bedford are the most common closure points -- steep grades combined with elevation create whiteout conditions faster than the surrounding flatlands. Monitor 511PA.com and the PA Turnpike alerts app for real-time tier status.



:::tip
The PA Turnpike is the most expensive toll road in the Northeast. A Class 5 truck crossing full-length twice per week spends over $10,000 per year in Turnpike tolls alone. Budget accordingly and always use E-ZPass.
