## The 5-Tier Winter Restriction System

Pennsylvania operates the most complex winter driving restriction system in the country. When PennDOT activates restrictions, they apply to specific highway segments -- not necessarily the entire state. Multiple tiers can be active simultaneously on different routes.

| Tier | Vehicles Banned | Chain/ATD Required | Speed Limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Empty trailers, school buses, RVs, motorcycles | No | 45 mph |
| Tier 2 | All Tier 1 + loaded tandem trailers without chains/ATDs | Yes for tandems | 45 mph |
| Tier 3 | Only loaded SINGLE trailers with chains/ATDs permitted | Yes, mandatory | 45 mph |
| Tier 4 | ALL commercial vehicles banned | N/A | 45 mph |
| Tier 5 | ALL vehicles banned except emergency | N/A | Road closed |

**The 45 mph rule applies the moment ANY tier activates.** This catches truckers off guard -- even Tier 1, which only bans empty trailers, drops the speed limit for everyone.

### What Counts as an ATD

Automatic Traction Devices (ATDs) are alternatives to tire chains. They deploy automatically when the wheel spins and retract when traction is restored. PennDOT accepts ATDs as equivalent to chains for tier compliance. Chains or ATDs must be ON BOARD your vehicle (readily available for installation) whenever winter tiers might activate. Carrying them is cheaper than being turned around at a checkpoint.

## Christine Law

Christine Law (Act 189 of 2018) requires ALL drivers to remove accumulated ice and snow from their vehicles within 24 hours of a winter storm ending. For truckers, this means:

- Clear the entire trailer roof, cab roof, hood, and all flat surfaces
- Clear all lights and windows
- Failure to remove ice/snow: $200-$1,000 fine
- If ice/snow dislodges and causes serious injury or death: up to $1,500 fine

The law exists because ice sheets from trailer roofs kill people. Pre-trip inspection in winter must include checking for ice buildup. Some truck stops and distribution centers have ice-scraping stations -- use them.

## Mountain Trouble Spots

### I-80 Poconos
Elevation changes through the Pocono Mountains create rapid weather shifts. Clear conditions at Bloomsburg can become whiteout at mile marker 260. The Poconos segment activates Tier 2+ more frequently than any other I-80 stretch in PA.

### I-81 Blue Mountain
The Blue Mountain segment between Harrisburg and Scranton gains elevation quickly. Southbound grades approaching the Susquehanna Valley create brake-fade risk in wet and icy conditions.

### PA Turnpike Alleghenies
The Somerset-to-Bedford stretch through the Allegheny Mountain tunnels is the most common Turnpike closure point. Elevation plus tunnel approaches plus steep grades create a convergence of winter hazards.

### I-76 (non-Turnpike)
West of Pittsburgh toward the Ohio border, I-76 runs through rolling terrain that accumulates snow faster than the flatlands in either direction.

## Real-Time Monitoring

- **511PA.com**: Official PennDOT travel information. Shows active tier restrictions by route segment.
- **511PA App**: Mobile version with push notifications for tier changes. Set alerts for your regular routes.
- **@511PAAlerts on Twitter/X**: Quick updates on restriction changes.
- **PennDOT commercial vehicle mode**: Use the 511PA app in commercial vehicle mode for audio warnings about low-clearance bridges and restriction zones.

:::tip
PA winter tiers can activate and escalate within hours. Check 511PA.com before every winter run, and have chains or ATDs on board from November through March. Getting caught without traction devices during a Tier 2+ event means parking until the tier drops -- which could be days.
