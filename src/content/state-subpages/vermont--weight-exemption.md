## The 99,000 lb Exemption Explained

Vermont allows 99,000 lbs gross vehicle weight on non-tolled Interstate highways with a 6-axle or greater configuration. No special permit is needed. This is authorized under a federal pilot program that has been extended for 20 years -- it is established law, not a temporary experiment.

Vermont is one of only two states with this kind of Interstate weight exemption. Maine allows 100,000 lbs. Together, they offer heavy haulers in New England a significant operational advantage over the standard 80,000 lb federal cap.

## What Qualifies

### Axle Configuration

The minimum qualifying configuration is 6 axles. A standard 3-axle tractor pulling a tri-axle semitrailer meets the requirement. Five-axle combinations remain limited to the federal 80,000 lb standard.

| Configuration | Axles | Max Weight |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| Standard 5-axle (3+2) | 5 | 80,000 lbs (federal standard) |
| 6-axle (3+3) | 6 | 99,000 lbs (VT exemption) |
| 7-axle (3+4 or 4+3) | 7 | 99,000 lbs (VT exemption) |
| 8+ axle | 8+ | 99,000 lbs (up to limit) |

### Which Interstates

The exemption applies to **non-tolled** Interstates in Vermont. Since Vermont has no toll roads, this effectively means all Vermont Interstates:

| Interstate | Route | Qualifies? |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| I-89 | NH border to Canadian border (130 miles) | YES |
| I-91 | MA border to Canadian border (177 miles) | YES |
| I-93 | Brief stretch near St. Johnsbury | YES |
| I-189 | Burlington area (3 miles) | YES |

### Axle Weight Limits Still Apply

Individual axle limits remain in force regardless of gross weight:

| Axle Type | Maximum |
|-----------|---------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | 99,000 lbs (with 6+ axles) |

Distribute your 99,000 lbs properly across all axles. An overloaded axle is a violation even if gross weight is within the exemption.

## Above 99,000 lbs: VT Haul Pass

For loads exceeding 99,000 lbs, Vermont offers the VT Haul Pass system -- a real-time permitting system that provides oversize/overweight permits with integrated bridge restriction data.

### VT Haul Pass Details

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Maximum permitted weight | Up to 150,000 lbs (with sufficient axles) |
| Permit type | Real-time, route-specific |
| Bridge data | Integrated -- system checks bridge restrictions on your route |
| Weekend/holiday restriction | No movement for loads over 108,000 lbs, 12 ft wide, or 100 ft long |
| Summer restriction | July 1 through Labor Day: same prohibition as weekends |
| Speed limit | 45 mph for loads over 90,000 lbs, 10 ft wide, or 75 ft long |

:::tip
VT Haul Pass permits do NOT override posted road restrictions. If a road is posted at a lower weight, the posting governs even if your permit allows more. Check your route carefully.

## Vermont vs Maine: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Vermont | Maine |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Maximum exempt weight | 99,000 lbs | 100,000 lbs |
| Minimum axle count | 6 axles | 6 axles |
| Permit required? | No (up to 99K) | No (up to 100K) |
| Which Interstates? | Non-tolled (I-89, I-91, I-93, I-189) | ALL (I-95, I-295, I-195, I-395) |
| Legal authority | Federal pilot program (20-year extension) | 23 USC Section 127(a)(11) |
| State highway limits | Standard 80K (studying increases) | 100K on General Law Highways |
| Above-exemption permits | VT Haul Pass (up to 150K) | Special permits (up to 130K+) |
| Toll roads? | None in state | Maine Turnpike (tolled, exemption applies) |

The practical weight difference is 1,000 lbs -- negligible for most loads. The key difference is that Maine extends the exemption to General Law Highways and has no toll considerations, while Vermont limits the exemption to Interstate highways but has no tolls anywhere in the state.

For carriers running heavy loads in both states, see the [Maine 100,000 lb weight exemption guide](/states/trucking-insurance-maine/weight-exemption/) for ME-specific details.

## Spring Frost Laws

Vermont, like Maine, imposes spring frost law restrictions on secondary roads from March through May. Weight limits are reduced on posted roads during the thaw season.

- **Interstate highways** are NOT affected -- the 99K exemption remains in effect year-round on Interstates
- **Secondary roads** may be posted at reduced weights
- **Delivery access:** If your final destination requires a secondary road during frost season, you may need to reduce your load below the posted limit

## VTrans Weight Limit Study

VTrans has been studying the possibility of increasing state highway weight limits beyond current levels. The exemption currently applies only to Interstate highways. If VTrans recommends expanding weight allowances to state highways, the operational advantage would grow significantly. Monitor VTrans announcements for updates.

## Insurance Implications

Running 99,000 lbs means longer stopping distances, higher kinetic energy in collisions, and more severe outcomes -- especially on Vermont mountain terrain with limited emergency services. Vermont state minimums are $25,000/$50,000/$10,000, with that $10,000 PD floor dangerously low for heavy-haul operations.

RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for carriers regularly operating at the 99K exemption weight. The [mandatory chain law on Route 9](/states/trucking-insurance-vermont/mountain-trucking/) adds another risk factor -- heavy loads on mountain grades in winter conditions demand proper insurance coverage, not minimum compliance.

## Practical Considerations

### No Toll Roads = Cost Advantage

Vermont has zero tolling costs. Combined with the 99K exemption (one trip instead of two), Vermont operations can be highly cost-effective for heavy haulers despite the limited infrastructure.

### Weigh Stations

Vermont operates only 3 weigh stations statewide:

| Location | Route | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Sharon | I-89 SB | Near Vermont Welcome Center |
| Bradford | I-91 area | Eastern Vermont |
| Mobile units | Various | Portable scales at various locations |

Low station count means less frequent stops but more targeted enforcement. Vermont State Police Commercial Vehicle Unit uses portable scales for targeted checks. Six-axle configurations at 99K are legal -- individual axle weights will be verified.

### E-ZPass

Not needed for Vermont (no tolls). However, if connecting to New Hampshire, Massachusetts, or New York, you will need E-ZPass for those neighboring states.
