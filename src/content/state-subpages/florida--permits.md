## Why Florida OS/OW Permits Are Different

Florida lets you issue your own oversize/overweight permits. The Permit Application System (PAS) portal allows self-issuance for loads within specific parameters -- no phone calls, no waiting for a reviewer, no 14-business-day processing time. For heavy haul operators working Florida construction corridor, this is a significant competitive advantage.

The catch: Florida has hundreds of waterway bridges with specific load ratings. Bridge formula compliance is not optional.

## Self-Issuance Limits

| Dimension | Self-Issue Maximum |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Width | 16 feet |
| Height | 18 feet |
| Length | 150 feet |
| Weight | 200,000 lbs |

Loads exceeding any of these limits require standard permit processing, which takes up to 14 business days.

## Permit Types

| Permit Type | Duration | Self-Issue? |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Trip Permit | 10 days | Yes |
| Annual Blanket | 12 months | Yes (within limits) |
| Vehicle-Specific Blanket | 12 months | Yes (within limits) |
| Route-Specific Blanket | 3 months | Yes (within limits) |
| Standard Permit | Varies | No (14 business days) |

### How to Self-Issue

1. Go to the Florida PAS Portal
2. Create an account or log in
3. Enter vehicle dimensions, weight, and route
4. System checks bridge clearances automatically
5. Pay permit fee
6. Print permit immediately

Total time: 15-30 minutes for a straightforward load.

## Operating Restrictions

### Daylight-Only Operations

Most oversized loads must travel during daylight hours only. Overweight-only loads can travel 24 hours.

### Holiday Restrictions

No oversized load travel on: New Year Day, Memorial Day weekend, Independence Day, Labor Day weekend, Thanksgiving weekend, Christmas Day.

## Escort Requirements

| Width | Escort Requirement |
|-------|-------------------|
| Up to 12 feet | None required |
| 12-14 feet | 1 escort vehicle |
| 14-16 feet | 2 escort vehicles (front and rear) |
| Over 16 feet | Standard permit required, escort plan reviewed by FDOT |

## Bridge Formula Compliance

Florida has more waterway bridges per highway mile than most states. Every OS/OW permit route is checked against bridge load ratings.

:::tip
If the PAS system rejects your route, it will show which bridge is the limiting factor. Often, a minor route adjustment of 5-10 miles will bypass the problem bridge and allow self-issuance.

## Weight Limits Reference

| Road Type | GVW | Tandem Axle | Single Axle |
|-----------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Interstate | 80,000 lbs | 34,000 lbs | 20,000 lbs |
| State roads | 80,000 lbs | 40,000 lbs | 22,000 lbs |
| State roads (ag/forestry) | 80,000 lbs | 44,000 lbs | 22,000 lbs |

The higher state road tandem limit (40,000 vs 34,000) is a significant advantage for carriers moving heavy loads that do not require interstate routing.

## Insurance for Oversized Loads

| Risk Factor | Insurance Impact |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Infrastructure damage | Liability for bridge/road damage if over permitted limits |
| Escort liability | Accidents involving escort vehicles may implicate the carrier |
| Route deviation | Operating outside permitted route voids the permit |
| Height strikes | Over-height loads striking bridges creates massive liability |

RMS recommends 1,000,000 CSL minimum for any carrier running OS/OW loads in Florida.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not checking bridge ratings before departing.** The PAS system does this for self-issued permits, but standard permit holders must verify manually.
2. **Traveling outside daylight hours.** Fines are steep and the permit is voided.
3. **Running during holiday blackout periods.** No exceptions.
4. **Ignoring county road restrictions.** State permits do not override local restrictions.
5. **Not carrying the printed permit in the cab.** Digital copies are not accepted at all checkpoints.
