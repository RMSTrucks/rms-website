## Tunnel Comparison

Baltimore has two vehicle tunnels and both restrict commercial vehicles differently. Getting the wrong one can mean an expensive detour.

| Feature | Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) | Harbor Tunnel (I-895) |
|---|---|---|
| Height Limit | 14 ft 6 in | 13 ft 6 in |
| Width Limit | 11 ft 0 in | 8 ft 0 in |
| Doubles Permitted | Yes | NO |
| Hazmat | Most prohibited | Most prohibited |
| Toll (5-axle, out-of-state EZP) | ~$36 | ~$36 |

## Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95)

The Fort McHenry Tunnel carries I-95 under Baltimore Harbor. At 14 foot 6 inches high and 11 feet wide, it accommodates most standard trucks and trailers. Four tubes handle traffic in both directions.

**Prohibited hazmat:**
- Propane in quantities greater than 10 lbs
- Bulk gasoline and flammable liquids
- Explosives (all classes)
- Radioactive materials
- Poison gas

## Harbor Tunnel (I-895)

The Harbor Tunnel is more restrictive. At 13 foot 6 inches high and 8 feet wide, oversized vehicles will not fit. ALL doubles (twin trailers) are prohibited regardless of size. The same hazmat classes prohibited in Fort McHenry are also banned here.

The Harbor Tunnel is an older facility with less clearance margin. If your vehicle is anywhere near the dimensional limits, use Fort McHenry on I-95 instead.

## The Key Bridge Collapse and Hazmat Routing

On March 26, 2024, the Francis Scott Key Bridge on I-695 collapsed after being struck by a container ship. Before the collapse, hazmat carriers used the Key Bridge to bypass both tunnels while staying on the I-695 beltway.

**Current situation (through approximately 2028):**
- The I-695 eastern loop through the Key Bridge site is closed
- Hazmat carriers must use the I-695 WESTERN loop around Baltimore
- This adds 15-25 miles and 30-45 minutes depending on traffic
- The western loop passes through the I-695/I-70 interchange, which is congested during rush hours

**Contact MDTA at (410) 537-1374 for current tunnel and hazmat routing information.**

## Decision Matrix

| Your Situation | Use This Route |
|---|---|
| Standard truck, no hazmat | Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) |
| Doubles (twin trailers) | Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) |
| Oversized (over 13ft6 or 8ft wide) | Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) |
| Hazmat carrier | I-695 Western Loop ONLY |
| Any vehicle over 14ft6 or 11ft wide | I-695 (check Key Bridge status) |

:::tip
If you are a hazmat carrier on the I-95 corridor, the Key Bridge collapse added significant time and miles to your Baltimore transit. Plan accordingly and check MDTA for reconstruction updates. When the bridge reopens (estimated 2028), it will restore the eastern bypass for hazmat.
