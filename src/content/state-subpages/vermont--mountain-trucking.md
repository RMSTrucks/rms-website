## The Green Mountains Define Everything

Vermont is the Green Mountain State, and the mountains define every trucking decision you make here. The terrain is not optional -- every route crosses or skirts the Green Mountain range. Interstate corridors (I-89, I-91) are generally manageable, but secondary routes like Route 9 and Route 4 present genuine mountain driving challenges with steep grades, tight curves, and weather that changes faster than forecasts can track.

## Mandatory Chain Law

Vermont is one of the few Northeast states with a mandatory chain law for commercial vehicles. This is not advisory. It is enforced.

### Who Must Comply

Heavy-duty vehicles with GVWR or GCWR over 26,000 lbs must carry and use chains on designated highways during snowy or icy conditions.

### Currently Designated Chain Control Area

**Route 9 (Molly Stark Trail)** between Wilmington and Bennington -- approximately 20 miles through the Green Mountains. This stretch is notorious for winter conditions including heavy snow, ice, and reduced visibility.

### Key Rules

- Chains required on **both** the motor vehicle and towed trailers
- Chain-up areas provided at designated locations along Route 9
- The state can designate **additional highways** as chain control areas based on conditions
- Enforcement is active during winter events

:::tip
Do not assume Route 9 is the only chain control area. Vermont can designate other highways when conditions warrant. Check VTrans road conditions before every winter trip.

## Route 9: Molly Stark Trail

Route 9 connects Bennington (western VT) to Brattleboro (eastern VT) across the Green Mountains. It is the designated chain control area and the most challenging truck route in Vermont.

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Length | ~40 miles total, ~20 miles chain control zone |
| Terrain | Green Mountain crossing, steep grades |
| Winter risk | HIGH -- snow, ice, reduced visibility |
| Chain requirement | Mandatory for vehicles over 26,000 lbs GVWR/GCWR |
| Chain-up areas | Designated locations at both ends of control zone |

## Route 4: Killington Area

Route 4 runs east-west from Rutland to White River Junction, crossing through the Killington ski area. The mountain pass section features steep grades that demand attention in any season and become hazardous in winter.

- **Terrain:** Steep mountain pass through Green Mountains
- **Ski traffic:** Killington is a major ski resort; winter weekends see heavy traffic
- **Winter risk:** Ice, snow, congested with ski traffic
- **Not currently a designated chain area** but conditions can be severe

## Route 100: Not a Truck Route

Route 100 runs north-south through the heart of the Green Mountains. It is scenic, narrow, and winding. It is NOT a truck route. Commercial vehicles should avoid Route 100 for through-travel. Use I-89 or I-91 for north-south movement.

## Interstate Corridors

### I-89 (Western Vermont)

I-89 runs from the New Hampshire border near White River Junction northwest through Montpelier to Burlington and the Canadian border. It is the primary north-south Interstate in western Vermont. Generally manageable terrain, but mountain weather changes rapidly.

### I-91 (Eastern Vermont)

I-91 follows the Connecticut River valley from the Massachusetts border north to the Canadian border. It is the eastern spine of Vermont. Terrain is less severe than I-89 through most segments, but northern sections see heavy winter conditions.

### I-93 (Brief Stretch)

I-93 passes through a brief stretch near St. Johnsbury, connecting to New Hampshire. Short but important for carriers routing through northern New England.

## Mountain Route Reference

| Route | Direction | Terrain Challenge | Winter Risk | Chain Required? |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Route 9 | East-West | Green Mountain crossing, steep | HIGH | YES (mandatory) |
| Route 4 | East-West | Killington pass, steep grades | HIGH | Not currently |
| Route 100 | North-South | Narrow, winding, mountain | AVOID for trucks | N/A |
| US 7 | North-South | Valley route, gentler | Moderate | No |
| I-89 | North-South | Mountain weather variable | Moderate | No |
| I-91 | North-South | River valley, generally mild | Moderate | No |

## Infrastructure: The Sparse Reality

Vermont has the most limited truck infrastructure of any state in our coverage area. This is not an exaggeration -- it is the defining operational challenge of trucking in Vermont.

### Truck Parking Directory

| Location | Near | Spaces | Diesel | Hours |
|----------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Maplewood Store | I-89 Exit 7 | 6 | Check | Limited |
| Shell | I-89 Exit 21 | 10 | Yes | Check |
| Springfield Irving | I-91 Exit 7 | 17 | Yes (3 lanes) | 24/7 |

Beyond these three known locations, truck parking options are extremely scarce. Plan overnight stops carefully. Consider stopping in New Hampshire or Massachusetts if Vermont parking is unavailable.

### Fuel Gaps

Northern Vermont has fuel gaps of 50-plus miles. Do not enter northern Vermont assuming you will find fuel along the way. Top off before heading into rural areas.

### Repair and Tire Shops

Few commercial truck repair facilities exist in Vermont. A breakdown in a rural area may mean a long wait for a tow from New Hampshire or Massachusetts. Carry basic tools and spare parts for minor issues.

## Speed Limits

| Road Type | Speed Limit |
|-----------|-------------|
| Interstate | 65 mph |
| US highways | 50-55 mph |
| Secondary roads | 35-50 mph |
| OS/OW permitted loads | 45 mph max |

## Insurance Implications

Mountain terrain, mandatory chain law zones, limited emergency services, and sparse infrastructure all contribute to higher severity outcomes when accidents occur in Vermont. A truck accident on Route 9 in a snowstorm may wait significantly longer for emergency response than one on a Connecticut highway.

Vermont state minimums are $25,000/$50,000/$10,000 -- that $10,000 PD floor barely covers a guardrail. RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for Vermont operations. The [99,000 lb weight exemption](/states/trucking-insurance-vermont/weight-exemption/) adds payload but also adds risk. [Maine winter operations](/states/trucking-insurance-maine/winter-operations/) face similar challenges in a flatter but equally remote environment.
