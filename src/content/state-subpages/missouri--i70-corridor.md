## 251 Miles: Kansas City to St. Louis

I-70 across Missouri is 251 miles of the busiest freight corridor in the heartland, and a $3 billion expansion project is reshaping the entire drive. From 2024 through 2028 and beyond, MoDOT is widening 200 miles from Blue Springs (east of KC) to Wentzville (west of St. Louis) from four to six lanes. You will encounter construction zones, lane shifts, and reduced speeds for years.

## The $3 Billion Expansion

MoDOT's Improve I-70 project is the largest highway construction project in Missouri history. Key details:

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Scope | 200 miles, Blue Springs to Wentzville |
| Work | Widening from 4 to 6 lanes |
| Cost | Approximately $3 billion |
| Timeline | Construction through 2028 or later |
| Phasing | Multiple segments under construction simultaneously |
| Impact | Lane closures, reduced speeds, shifting traffic patterns |

Construction zones create two compounding problems: accidents and parking. Fender-benders in work zones back up traffic for miles on a four-lane corridor with no shoulders. And construction staging areas take over existing truck parking, making an already severe shortage worse.

## Mile-by-Mile Guide

### Kansas City Metro (MM 0-30)

The KC end of I-70 is a tangle of interchanges with I-35, I-435, I-470, and US-71. Key navigation points:

- I-70/I-35 interchange downtown -- heavy congestion during rush hours
- I-435 loop provides a bypass around the KC metro for through-traffic
- US-71 (I-49) interchange south of downtown
- Blue Springs (MM 20-25) marks the eastern edge of the KC metro and the start of the expansion project

### KC to Columbia (MM 30-128)

This is the most ice-prone section of I-70 in Missouri. The terrain is rolling, and bridge icing in winter creates treacherous conditions. Key stops:

| Location | Mile Marker | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Concordia rest area | MM 58 | Routinely full after 6 PM |
| Boonville rest area | MM 98 | Routinely full after 6 PM |
| Columbia | MM 126-128 | University of Missouri -- game day traffic on fall Saturdays |

:::tip
Mizzou home football games on fall Saturdays flood I-70 near Columbia with game traffic. If you are running through on a Saturday in September through November, expect delays at the Columbia exits from mid-morning through early evening.

### Columbia to St. Louis (MM 128-231)

| Location | Mile Marker | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Foristell weigh station | MM 193 | Both directions, west of St. Louis |
| Wright City rest area | MM 200 | Routinely full after 6 PM |
| Wentzville | MM 208 | Eastern limit of expansion project |
| I-70/I-270 junction | MM 229 | St. Louis bypass route |

### St. Louis Metro (MM 231-251)

St. Louis is where I-70 converges with I-44, I-55, and I-64. For through-traffic:

- **I-270 bypass:** Take I-270 to avoid downtown St. Louis entirely. This adds a few miles but saves significant time and stress.
- **I-64 interchange:** Connects to I-270 and provides alternate east-west routing
- **Mississippi River crossing:** I-70 crosses into Illinois via the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge

## Truck Parking Crisis

I-70 Missouri has the worst truck parking shortage in the state. The numbers:

| Situation | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| Rest area capacity | All public rest areas over capacity at peak |
| Truck stop capacity | Approximately 75% over capacity at peak |
| Worst time | After 6 PM, especially Tuesday through Thursday |
| Worst areas | Concordia, Boonville, Wright City rest areas |
| Construction impact | Staging areas reduce available parking further |

### Strategies

- Park early -- by 4 PM if possible, especially midweek
- Use TruckerPath for real-time availability
- Iowa 80 at Walcott (I-80, 250 miles east of KC) is a fallback if Missouri is full
- Consider overnight in KC or St. Louis metro truck stops rather than fighting for rest area spots

## Weather Hazards

### Winter Ice

The KC to Columbia section of I-70 is notorious for ice storms. Key patterns:

- Bridge icing precedes road icing -- Missouri has hundreds of overpasses along I-70
- Ice storms can hit without visual snow, making the road look dry when it is slick
- MoDOT stages equipment, but initial treatment takes time
- Multi-vehicle pileups in ice events are a recurring pattern on I-70

### Fog

River crossings (Missouri River at Boonville, tributaries) produce dense fog in fall and spring mornings. Visibility can drop below 500 feet without warning.

## Weigh Station

The Foristell station (I-70 MM 193) west of St. Louis operates in both directions and is the primary I-70 enforcement point. Vehicles 18,001 lbs and above must enter when the station is open. PrePass and Drivewyze are available.

## No Tolls

I-70 through Missouri is completely free. Missouri state law prohibits toll roads. When I-70 continues west into Kansas, the Kansas Turnpike (I-35/I-70 overlap) does charge tolls with all-electronic collection. When I-70 crosses into Illinois to the east, no tolls apply on I-70 itself.

For coverage on the I-70 corridor, contact RMS at (208) 800-0640. The construction zone risk and ice exposure make adequate insurance non-negotiable.
