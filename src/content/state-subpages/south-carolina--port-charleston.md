## Port of Charleston: Deep Water Advantage

The Port of Charleston handles over 2.7 million TEUs annually and has the deepest channel on the East Coast at 52 feet. This depth advantage means the largest container vessels in the world can call at Charleston, and the cargo volume continues to grow. The Hugh K. Leatherman Terminal, opened in March 2021, adds significant capacity and is the newest container terminal on the East Coast.

## Truck Routes

### From I-26 (Primary Approach)
I-26 is the freight spine connecting the Port of Charleston to the inland Southeast. Take I-26 East toward Charleston, then follow port-specific routing signs to your assigned terminal.

### I-526 Bypass
I-526 (Mark Clark Expressway) loops around the north side of Charleston and provides access to the Wando Welch Terminal area without going through downtown Charleston. For Wando Welch deliveries, I-526 is the preferred route.

### Avoiding Downtown Charleston
Downtown Charleston streets are narrow, have low-clearance bridges, and impose weight restrictions on many roads. Stay on interstates and designated truck routes. Do not attempt to navigate downtown with a loaded container.

## Leatherman Terminal

The Hugh K. Leatherman Terminal on the former Navy base in North Charleston represents the future of Port of Charleston operations. When fully built out, it will handle 2.4 million TEUs annually by itself. The terminal features:
- Near-dock rail capability with CSX and Norfolk Southern connections
- Modern gate technology for faster processing
- Deep berths accommodating the largest container vessels

Check scspa.com for current gate hours and operational updates as the terminal continues to expand.

## Rail Connections

The Port of Charleston has both CSX and Norfolk Southern rail service, with the Inland Port in Greer (Upstate SC) extending the port reach 212 miles inland by rail. This intermodal connection reduces truck traffic on I-26 for containers moving to and from the [Upstate industrial corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/upstate/).

## Drayage Insurance Considerations

Charleston drayage operates in a moderate insurance environment compared to [Georgia Port of Savannah](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/savannah-port/) or [Louisiana ports](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/ports/).

RMS recommends for Charleston drayage:
- $1,000,000 auto liability
- [Cargo insurance](/coverage/cargo/) appropriate to container values
- Non-trucking liability for bobtail movements
- TWIC card costs as operating expense

The [SC corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/corridors/) covers the I-26 route from the port to the Upstate and beyond.
