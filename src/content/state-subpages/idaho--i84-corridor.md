## I-84 Overview: 276 Miles Along the Snake River

I-84 is Idaho's trucking backbone. It runs 276 miles from the Oregon border near Ontario to the Utah border near Snowville, following the Snake River valley for most of its length. This is the primary corridor connecting Pacific Northwest freight to the Intermountain West.

Unlike I-90 through the panhandle, I-84 does not have chain law requirements in Idaho. The corridor stays in the river valley, avoiding the mountain pass elevations that trigger chain enforcement. That does not mean the corridor is without hazards -- crosswinds between Mountain Home and Bliss have tipped trailers, and winter weather can create icy conditions even at valley elevation.

## Segment-by-Segment Guide

### Oregon Border to Caldwell (MP 0-29)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Flat to rolling, Snake River valley |
| Speed | Cars 80 mph, Trucks 70 mph |
| Services | Ontario (OR side), Caldwell (Exit 29) |
| Key Note | Last reliable truck parking before Oregon at Caldwell |

The Oregon border crossing puts you immediately into weight-mile tax territory if you are over 26,000 lbs heading west. Eastbound, you leave [Oregon weight-mile tax](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/weight-mile-tax/) behind.

### Caldwell to Boise (MP 29-54)

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Terrain | Urban/suburban, Treasure Valley |
| Speed | 65 mph (urban Boise) |
| Services | Full services throughout metro |
| Key Note | Boise metro congestion peaks 7-9 AM and 4-6 PM |

### East Boise Port of Entry (MP 66.6)

This is the major checkpoint on I-84. All vehicles 26,001+ lbs GVW must stop when open. Phone: 208-334-3272. PrePass and Drivewyze bypass available for clean carriers.

### Boise to Mountain Home (MP 66-95)

| Rest Area | Bliss (MP 133) |
| Key Note | Wind advisory area MP 95-120. Monitor weather reports. |

This is the most exposed section of I-84 in Idaho. Crosswinds from the south can push high-profile trailers without warning. Consider pulling off if sustained winds exceed 40 mph.

### Bliss to Twin Falls (MP 133-173)

| Urban Boise | 65 mph | 65 mph |

Stay in the right lane except when passing. The 10 mph gap means constant passing by cars.

## Connecting Corridors

- **Westbound into Oregon:** I-84 continues 376 miles to Portland. Prepare for [Cabbage Hill](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/cabbage-hill/) and the [weight-mile tax](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/weight-mile-tax/).
- **Eastbound into Utah:** I-84 continues to Tremonton and connects to I-15 toward Salt Lake City.
- **I-86 to Pocatello:** Exit 222 connects to I-15 for routes north to Idaho Falls/Montana or south to Utah.
- **I-84 does NOT have chain requirements in Idaho.** Critical distinction from the [Oregon side](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/chain-laws/) and from [I-90](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/).
