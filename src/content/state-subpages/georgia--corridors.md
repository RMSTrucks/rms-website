## I-75: Florida to Tennessee (355 Miles)

The longest corridor through Georgia runs from the Florida line north through Valdosta, Macon, Atlanta, and Dalton to the Tennessee border.

### Segment Guide

**MM 0-23 (Florida Border to Valdosta):** Flat terrain, moderate traffic. Weigh station at MM 23 serves as the first checkpoint for northbound Florida traffic. Fuel and parking available at Valdosta exits.

**MM 23-190 (Valdosta to Forsyth):** Long stretch through South Georgia agricultural country. Tifton weigh station at MM 64. Limited services between Cordele and Macon.

**MM 190-247 (Forsyth to Atlanta):** Forsyth weigh station at MM 190 is the busiest in Georgia -- bypass services through PrePass and Drivewyze are highly valuable here. Traffic increases significantly approaching Atlanta.

**MM 247-260 (Atlanta Downtown Connector):** I-75 merges with I-85. Expect congestion at all hours. Use I-285 bypass when possible. See the [Atlanta Freight Hub guide](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/atlanta-freight/) for bypass strategies.

**MM 260-355 (Atlanta to Tennessee):** Traffic eases north of Marietta. Ringgold weigh station near MM 342 is the last checkpoint before Tennessee. Winter weather possible in the north Georgia mountains above Dalton.

## I-85: Alabama to South Carolina (180 Miles)

### Key Points

**La Grange Weigh Station (MM 22.5):** First checkpoint after the Alabama border. Heavy truck traffic from the Birmingham corridor.

**Atlanta (MM 80-110):** All express lanes PROHIBITED for trucks. Stay in general-purpose lanes. Spaghetti Junction at I-285 requires advance lane positioning.

**Carnesville Weigh Station (MM 169-171):** Last checkpoint before South Carolina. Connects to the [Charlotte freight hub](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/charlotte-hub/) via I-85 North.

## I-16: Macon to Savannah (167 Miles)

The primary [Port of Savannah](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/savannah-port/) corridor. One of Georgia's most truck-dense highways by percentage of commercial traffic.

**Fuel Warning:** Limited services between Macon and Savannah. Fuel up in Macon or Dublin before transit. The stretch between MM 50 and MM 120 has minimal truck services.

Blichton weigh station at MM 144 serves port-bound traffic. Expect agricultural inspection activity during harvest seasons.

## I-95: Florida to South Carolina (112 Miles)

Georgia's coastal route connects Jacksonville to Savannah to Charleston.

**Darien Weigh Station (MM 54):** Primary checkpoint on the coastal corridor.

**Savannah Access (MM 94-109):** Multiple exits serve the Port of Savannah and metro Savannah. Exit 99 to I-16 West is the standard port approach.

The I-95 corridor connects to [South Carolina corridors](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/corridors/) at the Jasper County line and to [Florida](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/) at the Nassau County line.

## I-20: Alabama to South Carolina (200 Miles)

**Service Gap Warning:** East of Atlanta toward Augusta, I-20 has long stretches with limited truck services. Fuel and food options thin out significantly between Conyers and Thomson.

Augusta-area weigh station at MM 187-188 near the South Carolina border. The [I-20 corridor](/corridors/i-20/) continues into [South Carolina](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/) and westward through [Alabama](/states/trucking-insurance-alabama/) to [Louisiana](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/) and [Texas](/states/trucking-insurance-texas/).
