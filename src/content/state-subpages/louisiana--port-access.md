## Four Ports, Four Different Operations

Louisiana operates four major port facilities, each serving distinct cargo markets with different access requirements, terminal procedures, and drayage patterns. Understanding which port you are serving and how to reach it is essential before accepting a load.

### Port Comparison

| Port | Primary Cargo | Annual Volume | Access Route | Key Credential |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Port NOLA | Containers, breakbulk | Major Gulf port | I-10 to Tchoupitoulas St | TWIC, UIIA membership |
| Baton Rouge | Bulk, petrochemical | Mid-major | I-10 to River Road | Facility-specific |
| Lake Charles | Petrochemical, LNG | Growing | I-10 to local routes | Facility-specific |
| Port Fourchon | Offshore oil/gas support | Specialized | LA-1 only | TWIC for some terminals |

## Port of New Orleans (Port NOLA)

### Napoleon Avenue Container Terminal

The primary container facility at Port NOLA. UIIA (Uniform Intermodal Interchange Agreement) membership is required for chassis interchange. Customs bonding is required for international container handling.

**Approach Route:** I-10 to Exit 232 (Carrollton Ave), south to Tchoupitoulas Street, west to terminal entrance. Stay on designated truck routes -- New Orleans city streets are narrow and many have weight restrictions.

**Terminal Requirements:**
- TWIC card for all drivers
- UIIA membership for chassis interchange
- Customs bond for international containers
- Valid CDL and carrier authority

:::tip
During hurricane season (June through November), drayage rates at Port NOLA typically surge 15-20% as carriers price in evacuation risk and weather delays. Factor this into contract pricing.

## Port of Baton Rouge

Louisiana second-busiest port handles primarily bulk cargo and petrochemical products. Access is via I-10 to River Road along the Mississippi River.

The Baton Rouge port area extends along the river through an industrial corridor. Individual terminal procedures vary -- confirm gate requirements with the specific facility before arrival.

## Port of Lake Charles

Deep-water port serving the petrochemical and LNG sectors. Cameron LNG nearby has driven significant growth in truck traffic. Access is via I-10 through the Lake Charles metro area.

The Calcasieu River Bridge on I-10 is a bottleneck for port-bound traffic. Legislative committees backed tolling for a replacement bridge in 2024 -- monitor for updates that could affect drayage costs.

## Port Fourchon

### The Only Way In

Port Fourchon is the sole Gulf of Mexico access point for offshore oil and gas support operations. It is accessed exclusively via LA-1, a two-lane highway that runs south from Golden Meadow to the port. There is no alternate route.

**LA-1 Realities:**
- Two lanes, no passing zones for extended stretches
- Prone to flooding during storms and high tides
- LA-1 Bridge toll applies (verify current commercial rates)
- Heavy traffic during crew change days (typically Tuesdays and Wednesdays)
- Limited cell coverage in spots

**No special state permit is required** for standard commercial vehicles, but plan for traffic delays and zero bypass options. If LA-1 floods or closes, Port Fourchon is inaccessible.

TWIC may be required for certain terminal access within the port complex. Confirm with the specific operator before dispatching.

## Drayage Insurance for Louisiana Ports

Louisiana port drayage operates under the unique [legal framework](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/legal-system/) that makes the state different from every other Gulf port market. The pure comparative fault standard means even minor incidents can produce liability exposure.

RMS recommends for Louisiana port operations:
- $1,000,000 auto liability minimum
- [Cargo insurance](/coverage/cargo/) matching your highest container or cargo value
- Non-trucking liability for bobtail movements between terminals
- Customs bond coverage for international container handling at Port NOLA
- Consider pollution liability for petrochemical port operations at Lake Charles and Baton Rouge

The [I-10 corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/i-10-corridor/) covers the highway connections between all four ports.
