## Missouri Intrastate Authority: What You Need

Missouri requires intrastate operating authority for ALL for-hire carriers operating within the state. If you haul freight for hire within Missouri -- even if you also run interstate -- you need this authority. The process runs through MoDOT Carrier Express, an online portal that handles applications, insurance filings, and permits.

## New Carrier Checklist

Follow these steps in order. Missing a step will delay your authority.

| Step | Action | Details | Cost |
|------|--------|---------|------|
| 1 | Get a USDOT Number | Apply at FMCSA website if you do not already have one | Free |
| 2 | Register with MoDOT | Create account on MoDOT Carrier Express (MCE) portal | Free |
| 3 | Complete application | Online application for intrastate operating authority | Varies |
| 4 | File insurance | Form E (liability) filed through your insurance agent | Policy cost |
| 5 | Get vehicle markings | USDOT number + "MO" displayed on both sides of every CMV | Lettering cost |
| 6 | Buy regulatory decals | Annual decals from MoDOT for each vehicle | $10/vehicle |
| 7 | Set up IFTA | International Fuel Tax Agreement registration | Varies |
| 8 | Set up IRP | International Registration Plan for apportioned plates | Varies |
| 9 | UCR registration | Unified Carrier Registration (annual) | $76+ |
| 10 | BOC-3 filing | Process agent designation (if interstate) | $30-50 |
| 11 | Drug/alcohol program | Enroll in DOT-compliant testing program | $100-200/year |

## MoDOT Carrier Express Portal

MoDOT Carrier Express (MCE) is the single portal for Missouri commercial vehicle services. Everything goes through this system:

- Intrastate authority applications
- Insurance filings (Form E)
- OSOW permit applications
- Vehicle registration
- Regulatory decal purchases

### Application Process

1. **Create an MCE account** at the MoDOT Carrier Express website
2. **Link your USDOT number** to the account
3. **Complete the authority application** -- select property carrier, passenger carrier, or household goods
4. **Submit insurance proof** -- your insurance agent files Form E electronically through MCE
5. **Wait for approval** -- MoDOT reviews the application and insurance filing
6. **Receive authority** -- once approved, your intrastate authority is active

:::tip
Have your insurance agent ready before you start the application. The authority cannot be approved until Form E is filed, and RMS can file it the same day. Call (208) 800-0640 to set up insurance before you apply.

## Vehicle Marking Requirements

Missouri law requires specific markings on every CMV operated for hire:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|--------------|
| USDOT number | Displayed on both sides of the vehicle |
| "MO" designation | Displayed on both sides alongside USDOT number |
| Letter height | Minimum 2 inches |
| Contrast | Must contrast sharply with background |
| Permanence | Painted or applied decal (no magnetic signs for primary marking) |

Both the USDOT number and the "MO" designation must be legible from 50 feet during daylight. This is an inspection item -- officers will check during roadside stops.

## Insurance Requirements

### Intrastate Carriers

| Coverage | Minimum Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| Bodily Injury (per person) | $25,000 |
| Bodily Injury (per accident) | $50,000 |
| Property Damage | $25,000 |
| Hazmat carriers (10,000+ lbs GVWR) | $1,000,000 |

### Interstate Carriers

| Coverage | Minimum Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| General freight | $750,000 |
| Oil/petroleum | $1,000,000 |
| Other hazardous materials | $5,000,000 |

### RMS Recommendation

RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL for all Missouri trucking operations. The state minimums ($25K/$50K/$25K) are dangerously low -- one accident in the Kansas City or St. Louis metro area would exceed those limits immediately. I-70 construction zones increase accident risk further.

Missouri is tort-based with no PIP requirement. UM/UIM must be offered but can be rejected in writing. Workers' compensation is mandatory for employers with five or more employees.

## Regulatory Decals

Annual regulatory decals cost $10 per vehicle and must be purchased through MoDOT. These decals must be displayed on the vehicle and renewed annually. Operating without current decals is a violation that can result in fines during roadside inspections.

## Household Goods and Passenger Carriers

If you are hauling household goods or operating passenger vehicles, additional requirements apply:

- Financial statements may be required with the application
- Additional insurance coverages (cargo for HHG, passenger liability for buses)
- Specific tariff filing requirements for household goods carriers

## Annual Renewal

Missouri intrastate authority requires annual renewal:

- Regulatory decals renewed annually ($10/vehicle)
- Insurance must remain continuously in force -- any lapse results in authority suspension
- UCR registration renewed annually
- MCS-150 update every two years (FMCSA requirement)

## What Missouri Does Right

Missouri makes the new carrier process relatively straightforward compared to many states:

- Single online portal (MCE) for everything
- No mandatory safety class (unlike Kansas KCC)
- No separate state insurance filing system beyond Form E
- Clear vehicle marking requirements
- Reasonable regulatory decal costs ($10/vehicle)

The biggest advantage: no toll roads. Missouri law prohibits tolls, so your operating costs do not include surprise toll bills. Combined with moderate insurance rates, Missouri is a business-friendly state for new trucking operations.

For help setting up your Missouri trucking insurance, call RMS at (208) 800-0640. We file your Form E with MoDOT and get you covered the same day.
