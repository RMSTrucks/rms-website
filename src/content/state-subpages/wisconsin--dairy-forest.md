## Wisconsin's Industry-Driven Freight

Wisconsin's trucking patterns are shaped by three dominant industries: dairy, forest products, and paper. Each creates distinct routing patterns, seasonal demands, and insurance considerations.

## Dairy Tanker Operations

Wisconsin is America's Dairyland for a reason -- the state produces approximately 14 percent of the nation's milk supply. Dairy tanker trucks are a common sight on Wisconsin highways, particularly in the central and eastern regions.

### Key Dairy Corridors

| Corridor | Area Served |
|----------|------------|
| I-39 (Central WI) | Stevens Point, Wausau area processing plants |
| I-41 (Fox Valley) | Appleton, Oshkosh, Fond du Lac creameries |
| US 151 | Dodge County, one of the highest-producing dairy areas |
| WI 29 (East-West) | Connects central WI dairy farms to processing |

### Insurance Considerations for Dairy Haulers

- **Cargo insurance:** Milk is a perishable, high-value commodity. Spoilage endorsements are essential for tanker operations.
- **Spill liability:** A tanker rollover creating a milk spill triggers environmental cleanup costs and road closure liability.
- **Food safety:** Tankers must meet FDA food transportation requirements, and your insurance should reflect the compliance costs of a claim.
- **Equipment value:** Insulated stainless steel tanker trailers are expensive to replace or repair. Physical damage coverage at adequate limits is critical.

## Forest Products Hauling

Wisconsin's forest products industry is concentrated in the northern and central regions, and it is the primary beneficiary of the [frozen road program](/states/trucking-insurance-wisconsin/frozen-road/).

### Frozen Road Advantage

During frozen road declarations (typically mid-December through late February), raw forest product haulers can carry up to 98,000 lbs on 5+ axle vehicles -- a 22.5 percent increase over the standard 80,000 lb limit. This translates directly to more revenue per load and is a competitive advantage for Wisconsin-based logging operations.

### Key Forest Product Corridors

| Corridor | Area Served |
|----------|------------|
| I-39 (North of Wausau) | Northern Wisconsin logging operations |
| US 2/53 (Far North) | Superior area, Lake Superior timber region |
| WI 29 (East-West) | Connects northern forests to mills and processors |
| US 51 (North-South) | Central Wisconsin forest corridor |

## Paper Industry Freight

Wisconsin's Fox Valley (Appleton, Neenah, Oshkosh) is historically one of the largest paper-producing regions in the country. While the industry has contracted, significant freight volume remains.

### Paper Freight Corridors

- **I-41 (Fox Valley):** The primary paper industry corridor. Kaukauna SWEF (NB MP 153) monitors this traffic.
- **I-39 (Central WI):** Connects paper mills in the Stevens Point and Wisconsin Rapids area.
- **I-43 (Lake Michigan shore):** Secondary corridor for paper products moving to Milwaukee and beyond.

### Paper Freight Characteristics
- High-value, damage-sensitive cargo
- Often palletized and shrink-wrapped
- Requires dry, clean trailers
- Consistent year-round volumes (less seasonal than dairy or forest products)

## Agricultural Freight

Wisconsin's agricultural sector extends beyond dairy:
- **Feed corn and grain:** Harvest season (September-November) creates surge demand for hopper and grain trailers
- **Agricultural chemicals:** Seasonal patterns tied to planting and application schedules
- **Produce:** Cranberry harvest (September-October) concentrated in central Wisconsin

## Seasonal Freight Calendar

| Season | Peak Freight |
|--------|--------------|
| Dec-Feb | Forest products (frozen road), road salt |
| Mar-May | Agricultural chemicals, spring planting supplies |
| Jun-Aug | Dairy (peak production), construction materials |
| Sep-Nov | Grain harvest, cranberry harvest, forest products resume |

If you serve Wisconsin's industry corridors, talk to RMS about cargo insurance that matches your specific commodity. Dairy tanker operations, forest product hauling, and paper freight each have distinct risk profiles that generic cargo coverage may not adequately address.
