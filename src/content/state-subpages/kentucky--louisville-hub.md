## Louisville: Where Packages Move

Louisville is a global logistics hub built around UPS Worldport, the largest automated package handling facility in the world. Add the Amazon Air Hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG), a growing distribution center market, and three interstate highways converging at the Ohio River, and you have one of the busiest freight nodes in the central United States.

## UPS Worldport

UPS Worldport at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport (SDF) processes approximately 2 million packages per day. The facility operates primarily at night, with the main sort running between 11:00 PM and 4:00 AM. This creates a distinctive traffic pattern:

| Time | Traffic Pattern |
|------|----------------|
| 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM | Inbound feeder trucks arriving for sort |
| 11:00 PM - 4:00 AM | Sort operations, limited road traffic |
| 4:00 AM - 7:00 AM | Outbound delivery trucks departing |
| Daytime | Ground freight, commercial deliveries |

Carriers serving UPS operations should be familiar with the SDF airport road network and the security protocols for accessing Worldport-area facilities.

## Amazon Air Hub (CVG)

The Amazon Air Hub at CVG airport in Northern Kentucky (Hebron) is Amazon's primary air cargo facility. While technically across the river in Kentucky's Boone County, it functions as part of the greater Louisville-Cincinnati logistics corridor. The facility generates significant truck movements connecting air cargo to regional distribution centers.

## RiverLink: Ohio River Bridge Tolls

The Louisville Ohio River crossing is tolled through the RiverLink all-electronic system. There are no toll booths -- tolls are collected via transponder or license plate billing.

### Toll Rates by Axle Count

| Vehicle Class | RiverLink Transponder | License Plate (No Transponder) |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 2-axle | $2.08 | $4.16 |
| 3-axle | $6.24 | $12.48 |
| 4-axle | $10.40 | $20.80 |
| 5+ axle | $16.01 | $32.02 |

Rates increase approximately 2.5% annually. RiverLink transponders and E-ZPass are both accepted. Without a transponder, you pay double via license plate billing.

### Bridge Options

| Bridge | Route | Lanes | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Lincoln Bridge | I-65 Northbound | 6 NB | Downtown crossing |
| Kennedy Bridge | I-65 Southbound | 6 SB | Downtown crossing |
| Lewis and Clark Bridge | SR 265 (Gene Snyder) | 4 each | East End, less congested |

For through-traffic not needing downtown Louisville, the Lewis and Clark Bridge (SR 265/Gene Snyder Freeway) avoids downtown congestion entirely. The toll applies to all three bridges.

## Interstate Navigation

Louisville sits at the convergence of three major interstates:

### I-65 (North-South)
The primary freight corridor through Louisville. I-65 crosses the Ohio River into Indiana via the Lincoln/Kennedy bridges (tolled). The Spaghetti Junction interchange where I-65, I-64, and I-71 merge in downtown Louisville is one of the most confusing interchanges in the region. Know your exit number before entering.

### I-64 (East-West)
I-64 runs through Louisville connecting to Lexington eastbound and to southern Indiana westbound. The Sherman Minton Bridge carries I-64 across the Ohio River at the west end of Louisville -- this crossing is NOT tolled.

### I-71 (Northeast to Cincinnati)
I-71 merges with I-65 through downtown Louisville before splitting northeast toward Cincinnati. The merge zone creates congestion during peak hours.

### Congestion Patterns

| Time | Worst Segments |
|------|---------------|
| 6:30 AM - 9:00 AM | I-65 NB through downtown, I-64 EB |
| 3:30 PM - 6:30 PM | I-65 SB through downtown, I-71 NE |
| 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM | Moderate throughout |
| Night | Light except UPS Worldport area |

## Distribution Centers and Industrial Areas

| Area | Major Operations | Access |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| SDF Airport area | UPS Worldport, air cargo | I-65 to I-264 |
| Shepherdsville / Bullitt County | Amazon, various DCs | I-65 South, Exit 117-121 |
| Riverport Industrial Park | Manufacturing, distribution | I-264 to Cane Run Road |
| Jeffersontown | E-commerce fulfillment | I-64 East, Blankenbaker area |

Shepherdsville along I-65 South has emerged as a major distribution center cluster, driven by Amazon and other e-commerce operations. The area is accessible but parking is tight during peak periods.

## Truck Parking

| Location | Spaces | Access |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Pilot Shepherdsville (I-65 South) | ~100 | I-65 Exit 117 |
| TA Brooks (I-65 South) | 120+ | I-65 Exit 112 |
| Pilot Sellersburg IN (I-65 North) | ~80 | I-65 Exit 9 (Indiana side) |

Louisville parking fills by early evening on weekdays. The I-65 South corridor toward Shepherdsville and Elizabethtown has the most truck stop options.

## Connecting Routes

Louisville connects to [Indianapolis](/states/trucking-insurance-indiana/) via I-65 North, to [Cincinnati](/states/trucking-insurance-ohio/) via I-71 Northeast, and to Lexington via I-64 East. The [KY corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/corridors/) covers all major interstates through the state, including the I-65 corridor from Louisville to the Tennessee border. Remember that the [KYU weight distance tax](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/kyu-tax/) applies to all vehicles 60,000+ lbs on Kentucky roads.
