## Turnpike Overview

The Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-76) runs 241 miles across northern Ohio, connecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the eastern border to the Indiana Toll Road at the western border. It is the primary east-west transcontinental freight corridor through the state, carrying heavy truck traffic daily.

## 2026 Toll Rates

Rates increased 2.7 percent effective January 1, 2026. The Turnpike uses a ticket-based toll system where you collect a ticket at entry and pay at exit based on distance and vehicle class.

### Class 5 (5-Axle) Commercial Vehicle Rates

| Direction | E-ZPass | Cash |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Westbound (full trip) | $58.75 | $74.00 |
| Eastbound (full trip) | $49.75 | $62.75 |

**E-ZPass saves approximately 20 percent** compared to cash rates. The per-mile rate works out to about $0.226/mile with E-ZPass and $0.284/mile cash for Class 5 vehicles.

### Rates by Vehicle Class

| Class | Axles | Description | E-ZPass Per Mile |
|-------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 2 | 2 | Passenger, small truck | $0.037 |
| 3 | 2 | Medium truck, bus | $0.067 |
| 4 | 3-4 | Large truck | $0.150 |
| 5 | 5 | Tractor-trailer | $0.226 |
| 6 | 6 | Multi-trailer | $0.271 |
| 7 | 7+ | Oversize/special | $0.316 |

## E-ZPass Information

- E-ZPass is accepted and strongly recommended (20 percent savings)
- Compatible across 19 states
- I-PASS (Illinois) also accepted
- Cash lanes are available but slower and more expensive
- Use the [Turnpike fare calculator](https://www.ohioturnpike.org) for exact costs by entry/exit point

## Service Plazas

The Ohio Turnpike operates service plazas along the route with fuel, food, restrooms, and truck parking. Plazas are located approximately every 30-40 miles and serve both directions from a single location accessible via ramps from both sides of the highway.

## Oversize/Overweight on the Turnpike

The Ohio Turnpike Commission requires a **separate permit** from the standard ODOT permit for oversize/overweight loads. An ODOT hauling permit does not authorize travel on the Turnpike. Contact the Ohio Turnpike Commission directly for:
- Turnpike-specific OSOW permits
- Routing restrictions and bridge clearances
- Escort requirements
- Movement timing restrictions

## Weigh Station

The Hubbard weigh station (WB MP 232) near the Pennsylvania border is the primary inspection point on the Turnpike. All commercial vehicles must enter when the station is open.
