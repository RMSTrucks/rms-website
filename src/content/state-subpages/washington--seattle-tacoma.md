## Northwest Seaport Alliance Clean Truck Program

Starting **January 2026**, all trucks serving NWSA international AND domestic terminals must have:

- A registered RFID tag
- A 2007 or newer engine (or certified equivalent emission control)

Register BEFORE serving any NWSA terminal. A $6.2 million zero-emission drayage incentive program is funding 19 ZEV trucks.

## Toll Facilities

| Facility | Rate | Trucks Allowed? | Notes |
|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| Tacoma Narrows Bridge (SR-16) | $4.50 Good To Go! | Yes | Eastbound only |
| SR-520 Bridge | Varies | Yes | Both directions |
| I-405 Express Toll Lanes | N/A | NO (over 10K lbs) | Use general purpose lanes |
| SR-167 HOT Lanes | N/A | NO (over 10K lbs) | Use general purpose lanes |

**Good To Go! commercial accounts** are recommended for regular Puget Sound operations.

## Lane Restrictions

Trucks over 10,000 lbs are **banned from the left lane** on highways with 3+ lanes in King County, Snohomish County, and on I-90 in Spokane.

## Congestion Planning

The Tacoma-to-Seattle segment of I-5 is the heaviest congestion zone:

- **Peak congestion:** 6:30-9:30 AM and 3:30-7:00 PM
- **Best truck windows:** 10 PM - 5 AM for through traffic
- **Port operations:** Plan access around gate hours

## Weigh Stations

Electronic screening with automatic bypass for clean carriers.
