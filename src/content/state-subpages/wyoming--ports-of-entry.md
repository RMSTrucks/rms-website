## 14 Ports of Entry

Wyoming operates 14 Ports of Entry across the state -- dense coverage for a state with fewer than 600,000 people. All commercial vehicles with a GVW of 10,000 lbs or more must stop when directed. This includes vehicles hauling livestock, oversize, or overweight loads regardless of weight.

### Port of Entry Locations

| Port | Route | Location | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Cheyenne (East) | I-80 EB | Eastern I-80 | Near Colorado border, high volume |
| Cheyenne (South) | I-25 SB | Southern I-25 | Colorado border approach |
| Evanston | I-80 WB | Western I-80 | Near Utah border |
| Rawlins | I-80 | Central I-80 | Mid-corridor check |
| Rock Springs | US 430 | Southwest WY | Off-interstate station |
| Sheridan | I-25 NB | Northern I-25 | Montana border approach |
| Lander | US 287 | Central WY | Wind River area |
| Shoshone | US 20-26 | North-central WY | Yellowstone approach |
| Cody | US 14 | Northwest WY | Yellowstone east entrance area |

Additional stations operate on secondary routes across the state. With 14 total locations, Wyoming covers its highway network thoroughly despite its small population.

### PrePass and Bypass

PrePass is available at major Wyoming Ports of Entry. Green light means bypass; red light means stop. Without PrePass, always stop when the station is open. Drivewyze coverage is expanding -- check the app for current bypass-enabled locations.

For carriers running I-80 regularly, PrePass saves significant time given the corridor's three Port of Entry locations (Evanston, Rawlins, Cheyenne).

## Operating Authority: Permanent Once Issued

Wyoming's operating authority structure is one of the most carrier-friendly in the country. Once issued, authority is permanent. There is no annual renewal, no re-filing, no re-application. Keep your insurance current and your authority stays active.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Processing time | Same day (with complete application and Form E) |
| Duration | Permanent |
| Renewal required | No -- as long as insurance stays current |
| Insurance form | Form E only |
| Forms NOT accepted | ACORD certificates, binders, abstracts, insurance ID cards |
| Filing method | Postal mail or email to mvs@wyo.gov |

### Form E: The Only Accepted Filing

Wyoming is strict about this. The state does not accept ACORD certificates, binders, abstracts, or insurance ID cards for authority filing. Form E must be completed by a broker, underwriter, or authorized company representative. No exceptions. If your insurance agent sends an ACORD certificate, it will be rejected and your authority will be delayed.

## Height Limit: 13 Feet 6 Inches

Wyoming's height limit of 13 feet 6 inches is lower than most states, which typically allow 14 feet. This catches out-of-state drivers hauling tall loads who do not check Wyoming-specific limits before entering.

| State | Height Limit | Comparison |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Wyoming | 13 ft 6 in | LOWER than most |
| Colorado | 14 ft 6 in | Higher |
| Montana | 14 ft 0 in | Higher |
| Nebraska | 14 ft 6 in | Higher |
| Utah | 14 ft 0 in | Higher |

Loads over 17 feet in height require a front escort vehicle equipped with a height-measuring device.

## Oversize/Overweight Permits

| Permit Type | Cost | Notes |
|-------------|------|-------|
| Single trip oversize | $15 | Standard oversize dimensions |
| Extended period oversize | $50 | Multiple trips |
| Overweight | Varies | Bridge formula applies |
| Escort requirements | Required for width 14 ft 6 in+, height 17 ft+, length 120 ft+ |

Wyoming's bridge formula allows up to 117,000 lbs GVW on interstates -- above the standard federal 80,000 lbs. This gives Wyoming operations a weight advantage for properly configured vehicles.

## Weight Limits

| Category | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Interstate GVW | Up to 117,000 lbs (Wyoming bridge formula) |
| Standard federal | 80,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | 36,000 lbs |
| Tridem axle | 42,500 lbs |

## No Toll Roads

Wyoming has no toll roads. The state legislature specifically rejected an I-80 tolling proposal. Combined with no highway use tax and permanent operating authority, Wyoming's fee structure is among the simplest in the country.

## IFTA

Wyoming participates in IFTA. License cost is $10 plus $3 per decal set. Late filing penalty is $50 or 10% of tax due, whichever is greater.

## "No Unnecessary Travel" Advisory

During severe weather, Wyoming may issue a "no unnecessary travel" advisory. Under this advisory, en-route loads may proceed only to the nearest available parking. You cannot begin a new trip during the advisory period. This is not a suggestion -- it is an enforceable directive.
