## Statewide Chain Law

Oregon chain law is more aggressive than most western states. It applies statewide, not just on specific passes. When conditions warrant, ODOT activates chain requirements on any highway in the state. Commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs GVW must carry chains and install them when posted.

Oregon also uses **Conditional Road Closures** -- when a road is closed to vehicles without chains, ALL vehicles must chain up regardless of type, including four-wheel-drive vehicles.

## Key Mountain Passes

| Pass | Route | Elevation | Key Risk |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| Cabbage Hill / Blue Mountains | I-84 | 4,193 ft | 78% out-of-state crashes, 6% grade |
| Siskiyou Pass | I-5 | 4,310 ft | Steep grades both sides, frequent closures |
| Santiam Pass | US-20/OR-126 | 4,817 ft | Chain-prone, remote |
| Government Camp | US-26 | 3,888 ft | Mt. Hood area, heavy recreation traffic |

## Chain Requirements by Level

Oregon uses a multi-level chain requirement system:

- **Advisory:** Chains recommended but not required. Conditions are deteriorating.
- **Chains Required:** All vehicles without adequate traction must chain up. CMVs over 10,000 lbs must install chains.
- **Conditional Road Closure:** ALL vehicles must have chains installed regardless of vehicle type.
- **Road Closed:** Highway is closed to all traffic.

## Acceptable Chain Equipment

- Link chains (standard metal)
- Cable chains
- Approved traction devices
- Chain placement: at least two drive tires

## Real-Time Chain Status

Check TripCheck.com for current chain requirements on all Oregon highways. ODOT updates conditions in real time. Oregon DOT has confirmed API access for dynamic data.

## Comparison to Neighboring States

- **[Idaho](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/):** Chain law only applies to 3 specific passes. Narrower scope than Oregon.
- **[Washington](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/snoqualmie-pass/):** 69-mile Snoqualmie Pass chain zone with $500 fines. Aggressive but geographically limited.
- **Oregon:** Statewide activation. The most aggressive chain enforcement in the Pacific Northwest.

## Enforcement

Oregon State Police and ODOT enforce chain requirements at chain-up areas before mountain passes. Fines for non-compliance are significant, but the real cost is in crash liability. A CMV without chains in chain-required conditions that causes an accident faces both regulatory penalties and insurance implications.
