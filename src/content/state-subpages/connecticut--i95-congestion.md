## Congestion Overview

I-95 runs 112 miles through Connecticut from the New York border to Rhode Island. The southwest section between Greenwich and Bridgeport consistently ranks among the worst congestion corridors in the United States.

### Congestion by Segment

| Segment | Miles | Congestion Level | Rush Hour Delay |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greenwich to Norwalk | 15 | Severe | 30-60+ minutes |
| Norwalk to Bridgeport | 20 | Severe | 30-45 minutes |
| Bridgeport to New Haven | 20 | Moderate | 15-30 minutes |
| New Haven to Old Saybrook | 30 | Light | Minimal |
| Old Saybrook to Rhode Island | 27 | Light-Moderate | 10-20 minutes |

**Rush hours:** Monday-Friday, 7-9:30 AM and 4-7 PM. The PM rush is typically worse than the AM rush in southwest CT.

## Oversize/Overweight Movement Windows

CT restricts OS/OW movements based on time of day and load dimensions.

### Standard OS/OW Loads
- **Permitted:** Monday-Friday, daylight hours only
- **Banned during rush hours:** 6:30-9:00 AM and 4:00-6:00 PM
- **Not permitted:** Weekends, holidays, darkness

### Extra-Large Loads (over 13 ft 6 in wide or 14 ft tall)
- **Permitted:** Tuesday-Thursday ONLY, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM
- **Bridge capacity reviews** may be required before permit issuance
- CT has many older bridges with lower weight ratings than modern standards

## Timing Strategies

For carriers with schedule flexibility:

- **Cross SW CT before 6:00 AM or after 8:00 PM** to avoid the worst congestion
- **Midday (10 AM - 3 PM)** is the best window for SW CT transit
- **Weekend crossings** are significantly faster than weekday
- **Summer Fridays** (June-August) are the worst single day for SW CT I-95 congestion as beach traffic combines with regular commuter traffic

## Truck Parking

Truck parking along I-95 in Connecticut is limited:

- I-95 service areas have some truck parking but fill early, especially in SW CT
- Better parking availability along I-84 and I-91
- No overnight truck parking at most CT rest areas (4-hour limit)
- Plan to park in New York (south) or Rhode Island (north) if traveling during peak hours

## Connecting Corridors

I-95 through CT connects to:
- **South:** NJ Turnpike via I-95 through New York
- **North:** I-95 continues to Rhode Island and Maine
- **West:** I-84 at Bridgeport connects to Danbury, Hartford, and Massachusetts
- **North:** I-91 at New Haven connects to Hartford and Vermont

:::tip
If your delivery window allows it, cross southwest CT outside rush hours. The difference between a 7 AM transit and a 10 AM transit through Greenwich-to-Bridgeport can be 45 minutes or more.
