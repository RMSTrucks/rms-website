## Kentucky Weigh Station Master Table

Kentucky operates 17 weigh stations across its major interstates. PrePass and Drivewyze are both active. Weigh-in-motion technology is deployed at many stations, and Kentucky enforcement can verify [KYU registration status](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/kyu-tax/) during any stop.

| Interstate | Post | Location | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| I-75 | Post 7 | London | MM 33-34 | NB/SB | Southern KY, Jellico approach |
| I-75 | Post 5 | Scott County | MM 130.5 | NB/SB | North of Lexington |
| I-75 | Post 9B | Verona | MM 168 | SB | Near Cincinnati |
| I-65 | Post 3 | Elizabethtown | MM 89.5 | NB/SB | Western KY Parkway junction |
| I-64 | Post 4 | Shelby County | MM 38.5 | EB/WB | East of Louisville |
| I-64 | -- | Boyd County | MM 180 | EB/WB | Near WV border |
| I-24 | -- | Christian County | MM 77 | EB/WB | Western KY |
| I-71 | -- | Gallatin County | MM 64 | NB/SB | Between Louisville and Cincinnati |

## I-75: Cincinnati to Tennessee Border (192 Miles)

The primary north-south freight corridor through Kentucky, carrying traffic between the Midwest and the Southeast. I-75 threads through three distinct zones: the Cincinnati metro, the Bluegrass Plateau, and the Cumberland Mountains.

### Northern Kentucky / Cincinnati Approach (MM 175-192)

The I-75/I-71 merge near Covington creates a bottleneck where two major interstates funnel into one corridor. The Brent Spence Bridge over the Ohio River into Cincinnati is one of the most congested freight chokepoints in the country. A replacement bridge has been planned for years.

Post 9B Verona weigh station at MM 168 serves southbound traffic after the Cincinnati merge zone.

### Lexington (MM 104-115)

The I-75/I-64 interchange at Lexington is a major junction. I-64 heads east toward Ashland and West Virginia, and west toward [Louisville](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/louisville-hub/). The Lexington area has growing distribution activity, and the Toyota Georgetown plant north of the city generates significant freight.

Post 5 Scott County weigh station at MM 130.5 serves traffic between Lexington and Cincinnati.

### Jellico Mountain (MM 0-15): The Danger Zone

Jellico Mountain at the Tennessee/Kentucky border on I-75 is one of the most dangerous mountain crossings in the eastern United States. The grades are steep, the curves are sharp, and winter weather turns this segment into a jackknife corridor.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Grade severity | Up to 6% sustained |
| Elevation change | Significant climb/descent over 15 miles |
| Runaway truck ramps | Multiple -- know their locations |
| Winter closure frequency | Several times per season |
| Speed limit | Reduced through mountain section |

**Southbound (descending into Tennessee):** Select gear before the descent. Use engine braking as primary speed control. The [Tennessee mountain grades](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/mountain-grades/) continue on the other side of the state line.

**Northbound (ascending into Kentucky):** Sustained climb tests cooling systems and engine performance. Maintain momentum but do not exceed safe speed for conditions.

Post 7 London weigh station at MM 33-34 serves as the primary inspection point for trucks that have just crossed or are about to cross Jellico Mountain. CVSA inspectors focus on brake condition and cargo securement.

## I-65: Louisville to Tennessee Border (138 Miles)

### Louisville (MM 125-138)

The [Louisville freight hub](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/louisville-hub/) dominates the northern end of I-65 in Kentucky. RiverLink tolls apply on the Ohio River crossings. See the Louisville hub guide for bridge options and toll rates.

### Elizabethtown (MM 86-94)

Post 3 weigh station at MM 89.5 sits at the junction with the Western Kentucky Parkway. Elizabethtown is a military community (Fort Knox) with moderate freight activity.

### Bowling Green (MM 20-30)

Growing distribution center market anchored by the Corvette Assembly Plant. Bowling Green has attracted warehousing and logistics operations due to its position on I-65 between Louisville and Nashville.

### Tennessee Border (MM 0-2)

I-65 continues south to [Nashville](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/) and beyond. Relatively flat terrain at this crossing compared to the I-75 Jellico crossing.

## I-64: Louisville to West Virginia (192 Miles)

### Louisville to Lexington (MM 0-75)

The Bluegrass Parkway region. Post 4 Shelby County weigh station at MM 38.5. Moderate terrain, steady traffic between Kentucky two largest cities.

### Lexington to Ashland (MM 75-192)

Eastern Kentucky Appalachian terrain. Grades increase progressively as you move east toward the West Virginia border. The Boyd County weigh station near MM 180 serves traffic approaching the Big Sandy River crossing.

Winter weather creates hazardous conditions in the eastern section, particularly through the Daniel Boone National Forest area where ice forms on bridges through mountain valleys.

## I-24: Western Kentucky

I-24 crosses the western tip of Kentucky between Tennessee and Illinois. Christian County weigh station at MM 77. This corridor carries freight between Nashville and St. Louis.

The Land Between the Lakes area creates a narrow corridor where I-24 is the only practical routing. Traffic is lighter than I-65 or I-75 but can surge during recreational seasons.

## Winter Driving

Kentucky mountain corridors require winter preparation from November through March:

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Chain specifications | 3/4-inch cross chains, 10-inch spacing |
| Primary risk areas | Jellico Mountain (I-75), Eastern I-64, I-26 approach |
| Information | 511 system, goky.ky.gov |
| Bridge icing | Common on Ohio River crossings and mountain valleys |
| Closure frequency | Jellico Mountain closes several times per typical winter |

Carriers running regular routes through Kentucky mountain corridors should carry chains November through March and check conditions before committing to Jellico Mountain or eastern I-64.

## Tire Width Rule

Kentucky enforces an unusual tire width regulation: weight per tire cannot exceed 600 pounds per inch of tire width. This catches carriers running overloaded on narrow tires. Standard 11R22.5 tires handle typical loads, but carriers running specialized equipment should verify compliance.

## Tridem Allowance

Kentucky allows 48,000 pounds on tridem axles with 42-inch to 120-inch spacing -- more generous than most states. This is relevant for carriers operating tridem trailer configurations through the state.

## Connecting Corridors

I-75 continues north to [Ohio](/states/trucking-insurance-ohio/) and south through [Jellico Mountain to Tennessee](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/mountain-grades/). I-65 connects to [Indiana](/states/trucking-insurance-indiana/) northbound and [Tennessee](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/) southbound. I-64 reaches [West Virginia](/states/trucking-insurance-west-virginia/) eastbound. Remember: the [KYU weight distance tax](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/kyu-tax/) applies to all vehicles 60,000+ lbs regardless of which corridor you run.
