## I-95: Georgia Line to Miami (382 Miles)

Florida primary north-south corridor connecting [Georgia](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/) to Miami. Heaviest commercial traffic in the state.

### Left-Lane Ban (South Florida)

Trucks prohibited from the left lane in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties. Enforced for over 30 years. Fine: 121 dollars plus 3 CDL points.

### Mile-by-Mile

**Georgia line to Jacksonville (MM 380-350):** Yulee (MM 376) is the last reliable truck parking before the state line. [JAXPORT](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/ports/) access via I-295.

**Jacksonville (MM 350-340):** Use I-295 to bypass downtown. The I-95/I-10/I-295 interchange bottlenecks during rush hours.

**Jacksonville to Daytona (MM 340-260):** Moderate traffic. Flagler weigh station at MM 286.

**Fort Pierce to West Palm Beach (MM 130-70):** Left-lane ban begins. Express lanes start. SunPass required.

**Fort Lauderdale to Miami (MM 30-0):** Heaviest congestion. [PortMiami](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/ports/) via Port Tunnel from I-395. I-95 Express Lanes with dynamic pricing.

### I-95 Weigh Stations

| Location | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Yulee | 376 | SB | Last parking before GA |
| Flagler | 286 | Both | Between Jax and Daytona |
| Martin County | 92 | NB | Approaching South FL |
| Martin County | 112 | SB | Leaving South FL |

## I-75: Georgia Line to Naples/Miami (470 Miles)

Florida longest interstate. Left-lane truck ban from Georgia border to Florida Turnpike connection.

**Georgia line to Gainesville (MM 470-384):** White Springs weigh station at MM 450. Agricultural inspection station near the border.

**Gainesville to Ocala (MM 384-350):** High-speed, high-crash corridor through Ocala National Forest.

**Tampa (MM 260-240):** I-75/I-4/I-275 interchange complex. [Port Tampa Bay](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/ports/) access via I-4 or I-275.

**Alligator Alley (MM 80-0):** 80 miles, no services. 12.72 SunPass toll for 5-axle. Deadly fog history. Florida panther crossings. [Toll details](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/tolls/).

:::tip
Alligator Alley closes during fog events and wildfires. Check [FL511.com](https://fl511.com) before committing. If closed, the alternative adds 100+ miles.

### I-75 Weigh Stations

| Location | Mile Marker | Direction |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| White Springs | 450 | Both |
| Wildwood | 339 | Both |
| Punta Gorda | 160 | Both |

## I-10: Jacksonville to Pensacola (365 Miles)

Primary east-west corridor and main hurricane evacuation route.

**Lake City to Tallahassee (MM 300-200):** Long rural stretches. Cell coverage spotty. Madison weigh station at MM 263.

**Tallahassee to Pensacola (MM 190-5):** The loneliest stretch of interstate in Florida. Limited services, spotty cell coverage.

During tropical weather, I-10 can become a critical evacuation corridor with all lanes converted to one-way flow.

## I-4: Tampa to Daytona Beach (133 Miles)

One of America most dangerous highways. Seffner weigh station at MM 13.

**Disney/Theme Park Zone (MM 62-68):** Extreme congestion on weekends and holidays. Tourist drivers are unpredictable.

**Orlando (MM 68-90):** I-4 Express Lanes with dynamic pricing. SunPass only.

:::tip
Avoid I-4 through the Disney zone on Friday afternoons and Sunday evenings. Congestion can add 60-90 minutes to a 10-mile stretch.
