| Multi-trip | 90 days | Varies |

## Commodity-Specific Permits

Indiana offers generous commodity-specific weight allowances that are unique in the region:

### Steel and Aluminum

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum GVW | 120,000 lbs |
| Permit required | Yes |
| Route restrictions | Designated routes only |

### Agricultural Products

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum GVW | 97,000 lbs |
| Permit required | Yes |
| Seasonal availability | Year-round |

These commodity permits make Indiana attractive for heavy-haul carriers serving the steel mills in Gary/Hammond and agricultural operations throughout the state.

## Standard Weight Limits

| Configuration | Standard Limit |
|--------------|----------------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lbs |
| Tridem axle | 42,500 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000 lbs |
| Height | 13.5 ft |
| Width | 8.5 ft |
| Single trailer | 53 ft |

## Penalty Schedule (Effective February 14, 2025)

Indiana significantly increased OSOW penalties in 2025:

| Violation | Penalty |
|-----------|---------|
| First violation | $2,500 |
| Subsequent violations | $5,000 |

These penalties apply to operating without a required permit or exceeding permitted limits. The increase from previous penalty levels is substantial -- ensure your permits are current and your loads are within permitted specifications.

## Spring Thaw and Seasonal Notes

Indiana does not impose spring thaw restrictions on interstates. However, local roads may have seasonal weight postings. If your OSOW route includes county or local roads, verify seasonal restrictions with the local highway department.

:::tip
The commodity permits for steel (120,000 lbs) and agriculture (97,000 lbs) are a significant advantage for haulers serving those industries. If you regularly haul these commodities in Indiana, the annual permit at up to $2,000 pays for itself quickly compared to single-trip fees.
