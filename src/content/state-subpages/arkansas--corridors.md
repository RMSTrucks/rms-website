## I-40: Memphis to Oklahoma (284 Miles)

I-40 is the primary east-west corridor through Arkansas, connecting Memphis (and the Tennessee/Mississippi freight markets) to Oklahoma and points west. The route crosses the Mississippi River, traverses the Arkansas River Valley, and climbs into the Ozark foothills before reaching the Oklahoma border.

### Mile-by-Mile Breakdown

| Segment | Mile Markers | Terrain | Key Notes |
|---------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| West Memphis/Marion | MM 278-284 | Flat, Mississippi River crossing | Marion weigh station, heavy truck traffic from Memphis |
| Delta to Little Rock | MM 200-278 | Flat river bottom | Agricultural freight, fog risk along rivers |
| Little Rock metro | MM 150-160 | Urban | 30 Crossing Project complete (Nov 2024), I-30/I-440 interchange |
| Conway to Russellville | MM 80-120 | Arkansas River Valley | Scenic but ices in winter, rolling terrain |
| Ozark to Alma | MM 12-35 | Hilly, Ozark foothills | Alma weigh stations EB/WB near OK border |

### 30 Crossing Project Status

The 30 Crossing Project rebuilt 4.7 miles of I-30/I-40 interchange in downtown Little Rock. The project was substantially completed in November 2024. The rebuilt interchange should provide improved capacity and smoother routing through Little Rock compared to the construction period.

### I-40 Weigh Stations

| Station | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Alma | Near OK border | EB/WB | Both directions, Ozark foothills |
| Riverside | Near TN border | WB | Westbound approaching Memphis |
| West Memphis/Marion | Near TN border | SB | Southbound Mississippi River crossing |
| Lehi | Near MS border | EB | Eastbound |

## I-30: Texas Border to Little Rock (143 Miles)

I-30 connects the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex to Little Rock, carrying substantial freight traffic between Texas and the South-Central US.

| Segment | Mile Markers | Key Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Hope | MM 30 | Weigh stations EB/WB near TX border |
| Arkadelphia | MM 73 | Small city, limited services |
| Benton/Bryant | MM 116-120 | Suburban Little Rock |
| Little Rock | MM 130-143 | Merges with I-40 and I-440 |

The Hope weigh stations catch Texas border traffic in both directions. This is a primary enforcement point for loads entering Arkansas from I-30.

## I-49/US-71: Northwest Arkansas

I-49 runs through the northwest corner of the state, serving the Walmart/Tyson/J.B. Hunt freight corridor. See the [Northwest Arkansas Freight Hub guide](/states/trucking-insurance-arkansas/nw-arkansas-hub/) for detailed coverage of this critical region.

Key facts for corridor purposes:
- Connects to I-40 at Alma/Van Buren
- Heavy truck traffic through Fayetteville-Bentonville metro
- Hilly Ozark terrain, ice-prone in winter
- Continues north into Missouri

## I-55: Missouri to Tennessee (72 Miles)

I-55 crosses the southeastern corner of Arkansas through the Mississippi Delta -- flat terrain, agricultural freight, and fog risk along the river.

| Station | Location | Direction | Notes |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Bridgeport | Near MO border | NB | Northbound toward Missouri |
| Marion | Near TN border | SB | Southbound toward Memphis |

The I-55 corridor in Arkansas is short (72 miles) and relatively straightforward. Fog along the Mississippi River can be hazardous, particularly in fall and winter mornings. Agricultural freight (cotton, rice, soybeans) dominates this corridor.

## Weigh Station Summary

All Arkansas weigh stations sit near state borders on major corridors. Vehicles 10,001 lbs and above must enter when stations are open.

| Interstate | Station | Direction | Border |
|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| I-40 | Alma | EB/WB | Oklahoma |
| I-40 | Riverside | WB | Tennessee |
| I-40 | Marion | SB | Tennessee |
| I-40 | Lehi | EB | Mississippi |
| I-30 | Hope | EB/WB | Texas |
| I-55 | Bridgeport | NB | Missouri |
| I-55 | Marion | SB | Tennessee |

Drivewyze PreClear is active at Arkansas stations. PrePass is available at participating locations. Arkansas Highway Police conducts CVSA-standard inspections.

## Arkansas is Toll-Free

Zero tolls. No toll roads. No toll bridges. This applies to every interstate and highway in the state. Arkansas has studied tolling multiple times and rejected it each time. Your operating costs through Arkansas are fuel, maintenance, and time -- no toll surprises.

## Weather Hazards by Region

### Ozark Mountains (Northwest)
- Ice storms are the primary hazard, not snow
- Bridge icing happens faster than road icing -- Arkansas has many river crossings
- I-49 and I-40 west of Russellville are the most exposed sections
- December through February peak, but November and March events happen

### River Valleys (Statewide)
- Dense fog forms along the Arkansas, Mississippi, White, and Buffalo rivers
- Early morning (5-9 AM) is worst, especially October through March
- I-40 near the Mississippi River crossing and I-55 are most affected

### Delta (Southeast)
- Flat terrain with agricultural traffic entering from field roads
- Slow-moving equipment during harvest season (September-November)
- Flash flooding in low-lying areas during heavy rains

## Speed Limits and Regulations

- 70 mph rural interstate, 55-65 mph urban -- same for all vehicles, no truck speed split
- Intrastate authority required for for-hire carriers (ArDOT)
- OS/OW: continuous travel allowed for overweight-only loads under 108,000 lbs
- No chain law
