## Interstate vs. Intrastate: The Colorado Split

Colorado splits trucking authority between two regulatory bodies, and confusing them is one of the most common mistakes new carriers make in the state.

| Operation Type | Regulator | Key Requirement |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Interstate (crossing state lines) | FMCSA (federal) | USDOT number, MC authority, Form E insurance filing |
| Intrastate for-hire (within Colorado only) | Colorado PUC | PUC registration under 4 CCR 723-6, state insurance filing |

If you haul freight that originates and terminates within Colorado, you need PUC registration regardless of your federal authority. If you run interstate, you follow the standard FMCSA process but should be aware that Colorado-specific requirements like chain laws and the Eisenhower Tunnel hazmat ban apply the moment you cross the state line.

## Colorado PUC Registration

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission regulates intrastate for-hire carriers under 4 CCR 723-6. The process requires:

- Application to the PUC with business details
- Insurance filing with the PUC (separate from federal filing)
- Compliance with PUC operating rules
- Vehicle marking requirements (company name and USDOT number on both sides)

### Insurance Filing for PUC

The PUC requires its own insurance filing for intrastate authority. This is separate from your federal Form E. State minimums for intrastate are $25,000/$50,000/$15,000, but we recommend $1,000,000 CSL given Colorado's mountain operating environment. Your insurance agent must file directly with the PUC.

## COOPR Permit System

Colorado uses the COOPR (Colorado Online Oversize/Overweight Permitting and Routing) system at coopr.codot.gov for all oversize and overweight permits.

### Permit Types and Costs

| Permit Type | Cost | Processing Time | Notes |
|-------------|------|-----------------|-------|
| Single trip oversize | $15 base | ~2 hours | Standard dimensions exceeded |
| Single trip overweight | $15 base + $5/axle | ~2 hours | Above legal weight limits |
| Superload | Varies | 2-3 weeks | Currently extended due to staffing |
| Annual oversize | Varies | Application review | Repeat shippers |

:::tip
Superload permits are currently taking 2-3 weeks due to staffing constraints at CDOT, up from the normal 3-5 day turnaround. Plan ahead for any superload movements through Colorado.

### Routing Considerations

COOPR provides approved routing for oversize and overweight loads. Mountain corridor routing is particularly constrained -- the Eisenhower Tunnel has a [13-foot-11-inch height limit](/states/trucking-insurance-colorado/eisenhower-tunnel/), and many mountain highways have width and weight restrictions that limit oversize options. Always get your routing through COOPR before moving an oversize load through Colorado.
