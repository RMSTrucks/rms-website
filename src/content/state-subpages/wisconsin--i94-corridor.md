## Corridor Overview

I-94 is Wisconsin's primary freight artery, carrying approximately 33,000 trucks per day at peak through the Milwaukee metro area. The corridor connects [Chicago](/states/trucking-insurance-illinois/) to the south with [Minneapolis](/states/trucking-insurance-minnesota/) to the west, making it one of the busiest commercial vehicle routes in the Midwest.

## SWEF Locations Along I-94

Wisconsin calls its weigh stations Safety and Weight Enforcement Facilities (SWEFs). Along the I-94 corridor:

| SWEF | Location | Direction | Mile Post |
|------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Pleasant Prairie | Near IL border | Northbound | MP 349 |
| Warren | Near MN border | Eastbound | MP 8 |
| Red Cedar | Near MN border | Westbound | MP 48 |

Vehicles over 10,000 lbs must stop at open SWEFs. Virtual Weigh-In-Motion (VWIM) technology screens some vehicles at highway speed.

## Milwaukee Metro Navigation

### Zoo Interchange

The Zoo Interchange (I-94/I-41/US 45) is Milwaukee's most complex and chronically congested interchange. Construction has been ongoing for years, and lane configurations change frequently. Key tips:
- Avoid during rush hours (7-9 AM, 4-6:30 PM) if possible
- Stay in the correct lane well before the interchange -- last-minute lane changes cause most incidents
- Check WisDOT 511 for current construction status and lane configurations

### I-94 Through Downtown Milwaukee

I-94 runs through central Milwaukee with:
- Reduced speed zones in construction areas
- Tight curves and limited sight lines in older sections
- Frequent ramp congestion during business hours
- The Marquette Interchange (I-94/I-43/I-794) requires attention to signage

## I-94 to I-90/94 Through Madison

I-94 merges with I-90 south of Madison and continues as I-90/94 through the capital area. The corridor then splits:
- **I-90 west:** To La Crosse and Minnesota via the scenic Driftless Area
- **I-94 northwest:** To Eau Claire and Minneapolis

### Madison Beltline

The US 12/18 Beltline Highway around Madison's south side is a known congestion point. If your I-90/94 route takes you through the Madison area, be prepared for stop-and-go traffic during commute hours.

## Truck Parking on I-94

Parking pressure is heaviest on I-94 between Milwaukee and the Illinois border, where the Chicago-bound freight traffic creates demand that far exceeds supply.

### Key Parking Facilities

- **Sparta rest area (I-90):** Recently renovated with a $12.5 million investment that expanded truck parking from 12 to 70 spaces
- **Pleasant Prairie SWEF area:** Limited parking near the Illinois border
- **I-94 rest areas:** Sensors and cameras monitor 483 truck parking stalls across 11 rest areas statewide, with 3 more locations coming by 2027

## Seasonal Considerations

### Winter
- Lake Michigan lake-effect snow affects the Milwaukee area and I-94 south to the IL border
- The Driftless Area along I-90 west of Madison has steep grades and curves combined with severe winter weather
- No chain law, but chains are permitted for safety

### Spring Thaw
- I-94 itself is not typically affected by spring thaw restrictions
- Local roads connecting to I-94 may have seasonal weight postings

## No Tolls

Unlike the Chicago Skyway at the southern end or toll roads in neighboring states, I-94 through Wisconsin is completely toll-free. This is a meaningful cost advantage for carriers running the Chicago-Minneapolis corridor who can choose routing through Wisconsin.
