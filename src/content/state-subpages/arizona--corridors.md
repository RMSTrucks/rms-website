## TPAS: Real-Time Truck Parking

Arizona Truck Parking Availability System provides real-time data at these I-10 locations:

| Location | Route | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Ehrenberg | I-10 | Active |
| Bouse Wash | I-10 | Active |
| Texas Canyon | I-10 | Active |
| San Simon | I-10 | Active |

Available on az511.gov. Arizona is adding **846 new truck parking spaces** at 10 locations.

## Ports of Entry

| Station | Route | Location |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sanders | I-40 WB | MP 340.5 (NM border) |
| Ehrenberg | I-10 | CA border |
| Page | US-89 Alt | MP 551 (UT border area) |
| Nogales/Mariposa | I-19/SR-189 | Mexico border |

All commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs must enter when open. Lighted signs indicate "TRUCK OK TO BYPASS" or "TRUCK MUST EXIT." PrePass accepted.

## Speed Limits

No differential truck speed limit in Arizona. Trucks follow the same posted speed as cars: 75 mph rural interstate, 55-65 mph urban. This may change -- differential legislation is being considered for 2026.

## Cell Coverage

Major interstates (I-10, I-17, I-40) have generally good cell coverage on major carriers. Coverage degrades on secondary routes, especially in remote southern and western Arizona desert.

## Fuel Planning

Unlike [Nevada I-80](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/i80-fuel-guide/) where fuel gaps are a real concern, Arizona interstates have regular fuel stops along I-10 and I-40. The primary concern is secondary routes and I-17 between Phoenix and Flagstaff where options are limited.
