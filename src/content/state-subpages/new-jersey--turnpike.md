## Route Overview

The NJ Turnpike runs 122 miles from the Delaware Memorial Bridge (southern terminus) to the George Washington Bridge (northern terminus). It IS I-95 through New Jersey. Every carrier running the I-95 corridor between Washington DC and New York City crosses the NJ Turnpike.

## Dual Roadway System

North of Exit 11 (Woodbridge), the NJ Turnpike splits into two physically separated roadways:

- **Outer Roadway (eastern lanes):** ALL vehicles including trucks. This is where trucks MUST travel.
- **Inner Roadway (western lanes):** Cars only. No trucks permitted.

South of Exit 11, the roadway is a single combined facility for all traffic. The split begins at milepost 83 and continues to the northern terminus.

## 2026 Toll Rates

The NJ Turnpike Authority implemented a 3% toll increase effective January 1, 2026. The Turnpike uses a closed toll system -- you take a ticket at entry and pay based on distance traveled at exit.

| Vehicle Class | Description | Full-Length Toll (E-ZPass) |
|---|---|---|
| Class 1 | 2-axle, single unit | ~$16 |
| Class 2 | 2-axle, pulling trailer | ~$24 |
| Class 3 | 3-axle | ~$30 |
| Class 4 | 4-axle | ~$42 |
| Class 5 | 5-axle | ~$55-60 |
| Class 6 | 6-axle | ~$65 |

Toll By Mail adds a 15-20% surcharge over E-ZPass rates. There is no cash toll option on the NJ Turnpike -- it is either E-ZPass or Toll By Mail.

## Speed Limits

- South of milepost 97: 65 mph
- North of milepost 97: 55 mph
- Newark Bay Extension: 50 mph
- Work zones: 45 mph (doubled fines)

No separate truck speed limit exists on the NJ Turnpike. All vehicles follow the same posted limits.

| 16W | NJ 3 | Lincoln Tunnel |
| 18W | I-95 | George Washington Bridge |

## Service Areas and Truck Parking

The NJ Turnpike has 12 service areas (6 in each direction), each with fuel, food, and limited truck parking. Service area truck parking fills up quickly, especially in the northern section near the port exits.

**Plan ahead:** If you need to rest near Port Newark or the NYC crossings, secure parking by early evening. After dark, service area truck spaces are typically full.

:::tip
The NJ Turnpike has no cash toll lanes. E-ZPass is the only way to avoid the Toll By Mail surcharge. If you run the I-95 corridor regularly, an E-ZPass account pays for itself within a few crossings.
