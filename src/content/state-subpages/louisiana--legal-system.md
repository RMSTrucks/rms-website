## Why Louisiana Is Different

Every other state in the US bases its legal system on English common law -- a system built on judicial precedent where courts follow prior rulings. Louisiana operates under civil law, derived from the Napoleonic Code that France established in 1804. This is not academic trivia. It directly affects how trucking lawsuits proceed, how liability is determined, and how much you pay for insurance.

### Common Law vs. Civil Law: What It Means for Truckers

| Feature | Common Law (49 States) | Civil Law (Louisiana) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Legal basis | Judicial precedent | Written code and statutes |
| Liability standard | Comparative negligence (varies) | Pure comparative fault |
| Filing deadline | Statute of limitations (2-6 years) | Prescriptive period (1 year) |
| Jury behavior | Follow precedent | Interpret code directly |
| Predictability | Higher (precedent-based) | Lower (code interpretation varies) |

## Pure Comparative Fault

In most states, if you are found more than 50% at fault in an accident, you cannot recover damages. Louisiana uses pure comparative fault: a plaintiff who is 99% at fault can still recover 1% of their damages from you. This means virtually every accident in Louisiana has potential liability exposure for carriers, regardless of fault distribution.

For a trucker, this means an incident where you are clearly not the primary cause can still result in a claim against your insurance. Your coverage must account for this exposure.

## The 1-Year Prescriptive Period

Louisiana does not use the term "statute of limitations." Instead, it uses "prescriptive period," and for most personal injury claims, that period is one year. This is shorter than most states, which means claims come fast in Louisiana. Carriers operating in the state should expect faster claim notifications and shorter timelines for legal proceedings.

## The 2024 Direct Action Statute Reform

### What Changed

Before August 1, 2024, Louisiana allowed plaintiffs to sue insurance companies directly alongside the insured. This was known as the Direct Action Statute, and it had a measurable effect on trucking insurance costs. Juries who knew the insurance company name and the policy limits tended to award higher damages.

Act 275, effective August 1, 2024, severely restricted direct action:

| Before Act 275 | After Act 275 |
|----------------|---------------|
| Plaintiffs could name insurer as defendant | Insurer generally cannot be named |
| Jury knew insurer identity | Insurer identity concealed from jury |
| Policy limits discoverable | Policy limits generally protected |
| Broad direct action rights | Limited to 7 narrow exceptions |

### The 7 Exceptions Where Direct Action Survives

Direct action remains available when:
1. The insured has been declared bankrupt
2. The insured is insolvent
3. Service of process cannot be made on the insured
4. The cause of action is for damages for injury by an uninsured motorist
5. The insured is deceased
6. The insured is a foreign corporation with no agent for service in Louisiana
7. The policy specifically provides for direct action

### Will This Lower Rates?

Probably, but not immediately. Insurance carriers need to see sustained claims data under the new rules before adjusting rates. The reform is being challenged in courts, and until the legal challenges resolve, carriers maintain cautious pricing. RMS expects gradual improvement over 2-3 years if the reform stands.

## Practical Implications for Carriers

Louisiana litigation environment means:
- Carry above minimums. The state personal auto minimum of [$15K/$30K/$25K](/states/trucking-insurance-louisiana/) is dangerously inadequate for commercial vehicles.
- RMS recommends $1,000,000 CSL minimum for any Louisiana operations
- Work with attorneys who understand Louisiana civil law, not just common law
- Document everything -- Louisiana code interpretation can hinge on specific facts
- Claims come fast due to the 1-year prescriptive period -- report incidents immediately
- The 2024 reform helps but is not a reason to reduce coverage

For carriers also operating in neighboring [Texas](/states/trucking-insurance-texas/) or [Arkansas](/states/trucking-insurance-arkansas/), understand that crossing into Louisiana changes the legal framework entirely. Your Texas claim experience does not predict Louisiana outcomes.
