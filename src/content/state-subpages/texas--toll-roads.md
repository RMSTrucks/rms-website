## The First Rule of Texas Tolls

E-ZPass does not work in Texas. Full stop. If you are running a truck into the DFW Metroplex or Houston for the first time, get a Texas toll tag before you cross the state line. Without one, every toll facility bills you at double the rate through ZipCash. An 18-wheeler crossing Houston toll network daily saves over 2,000 dollars per year with an electronic tag versus ZipCash billing.

## Tag Comparison

| Tag | Issuer | Works On | Best For |
|-----|--------|----------|----------|
| **TollTag** | NTTA (North Texas) | All TX toll roads | DFW-based carriers |
| **EZ TAG** | HCTRA (Harris County) | All TX toll roads | Houston-based carriers (10 percent HCTRA discount) |
| **TxTag** | TxDOT | All TX toll roads | Carriers splitting time between DFW and Houston |
| **E-ZPass** | Various | **NOT compatible** | Does not work anywhere in Texas |

:::tip
If your trucks run Houston regularly, get an EZ TAG. The 10 percent HCTRA discount on Houston toll facilities adds up fast on daily runs. HCTRA took over TxTag operations in November 2024.

## DFW Toll Network (NTTA)

The North Texas Tollway Authority operates an extensive network across DFW. Base rate: 0.22 per mile with electronic tag, 0.44 per mile ZipCash (double).

| Facility | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Dallas North Tollway | Downtown Dallas to Frisco | Heavy commuter traffic |
| President George Bush Turnpike | Ring road around DFW | Primary truck bypass |
| Sam Rayburn Tollway (SH 121) | Lewisville to McKinney | Connects to I-35E |
| LBJ Express (I-635) | Managed lanes | Dynamic pricing |
| North Tarrant Express | Fort Worth managed lanes | Dynamic pricing |

## Houston Toll Network (HCTRA)

EZ TAG gives a 10 percent discount on all HCTRA facilities.

| Facility | Connects | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Beltway 8 / Sam Houston Tollway | Ring road around Houston | Primary truck bypass, Port of Houston access |
| Hardy Toll Road | Downtown to IAH area | North-south alternative to I-45 |
| Ship Channel Bridge | East Houston | Port of Houston direct access |

## SH-130: The Austin Bypass That Pays for Itself

| Factor | I-35 Through Austin | SH-130 Bypass |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Toll cost** | Free | About 32 dollars (full length, 5-axle) |
| **Speed limit** | 60-65 mph | 85 mph |
| **Free-flowing** | 18 percent of the time | 99 percent of the time |
| **Time saved** | -- | 30-90 minutes typical |

The Capital Express Central project on I-35 through Austin will be disruptive through 2028+. During construction, SH-130 is not just faster -- it is the only reliable option.

## Toll Budgeting

| Operation | Weekly Tolls | Annual Tolls |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| DFW local/regional | 75-200 | 3,900-10,400 |
| Houston drayage | 100-250 | 5,200-13,000 |
| I-35 corridor (includes SH-130) | 64-128 | 3,300-6,600 |

## Money-Saving Strategies

1. **Get an electronic tag immediately.** Double-rate ZipCash billing is the most expensive mistake a new Texas carrier makes.
2. **Use EZ TAG if Houston is primary.** The 10 percent HCTRA discount compounds across every Houston toll run.
3. **Budget SH-130 into I-35 runs.** The time savings alone justify the toll during construction.
4. **Track toll spending monthly.** Texas tolls are a deductible operating expense.
