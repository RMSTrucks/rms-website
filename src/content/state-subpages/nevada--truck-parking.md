## The Deficit Is Real

Nevada has one of the worst truck parking shortages in the western United States. Unlike [Arizona](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/corridors/), which is actively deploying the TPAS real-time parking system with 846 new spaces, Nevada is still in early stages of addressing the crisis.

| Region | Deficit | Context |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Clark County (Las Vegas) | 550+ spaces | Highest demand corridor in the state |
| Washoe County (Reno) | 250+ spaces | Growing e-commerce distribution hub |
| I-80 rural corridor | Moderate | Limited options between major towns |
| Secondary routes | Severe | US-93, US-95 have zero-amenity stretches |

## Zero-Amenity Routes

These routes have NO truck parking with amenities (fuel, food, restrooms) for stretches of two hours or more:

| Route | Segment | Approximate Distance |
|-------|---------|--------------------|
| US-93 | Las Vegas to Ely | ~240 miles |
| US-93 | Tonopah to Fernley | ~170 miles |
| US-95 | Winnemucca to Marsing (OR border) | ~200 miles |

If you are running any of these routes, plan your rest before you leave the interstate. There is no backup plan on US-93 or US-95.

## I-80 Parking Options

I-80 is better than the secondary routes but still constrained. Refer to the [I-80 fuel and service guide](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/i80-fuel-guide/) for mile-by-mile service stops. The towns with the best truck parking:

| Location | Parking Availability | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Reno/Sparks | Good | 50 new spaces from I-80 widening project |
| Fernley | Moderate | Pilot and independent stops |
| Lovelock | Limited | Small town, fills up quickly |
| Winnemucca | Good | Multiple truck stops at US-95 junction |
| Battle Mountain | Limited | Fuel available, parking tight |
| Elko | Good | Major hub with multiple options |
| Wells | Limited | Last stop before Utah |
| Wendover | Moderate | Border town with truck stops |

## I-15 Parking Options

The Las Vegas corridor on I-15 has the highest demand and the worst deficit.

| Location | Parking Availability | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|-------|
| Primm | Good | CA state line truck stops |
| Las Vegas south | Limited | Jean has some options |
| Las Vegas metro | Very limited | 550+ space deficit, intense competition |
| North Las Vegas | Moderate | Some industrial parking areas |
| Mesquite | Limited | Last services before Utah |

## HOS Planning Strategy

The fundamental rule for Nevada: **plan your hours of service before entering the state.** Do not assume you will find parking when your clock runs out.

### Eastbound on I-80 (from California)

If you are entering Nevada from California, your clock has been running through the Sierra Nevada. Reno/Sparks is your first reliable parking. If your HOS will not carry you to Winnemucca or Elko, stop in Reno. Do not start the 410-mile crossing without enough hours to reach a known stop.

### Westbound on I-80 (from Utah)

Wendover has parking, but it fills up. Wells is your next option. If your clock will not reach Elko (170+ miles from Wendover), do not enter Nevada from Utah. Park at a Utah truck stop and start fresh.

### Northbound/Southbound on I-15

Coming from California, Primm is your last reliable stop before Las Vegas metro congestion eats your hours. Coming from Utah/Arizona, Mesquite is thin on parking. St. George, Utah has better options -- consider stopping there.

## Expansion Plans

Nevada is beginning to address the deficit:

- **Golconda Summit:** New truck parking facility on I-80
- **I-80 Reno-Sparks:** 50 new spaces from widening project
- **TPAS Development:** Real-time truck parking availability systems being planned for I-15 and I-80, similar to the [Arizona TPAS system](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/corridors/)

These additions will help, but the deficit -- especially in Clark County -- remains severe.

## Insurance Connection

Drivers forced into unsafe parking situations due to the parking deficit face increased risk of theft, vandalism, and roadside incidents. Physical damage and cargo coverage are especially important for Nevada operations. Under [SB 180](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/insurance-changes/), liability minimums are increasing to $1M by January 2026. Contact RMS at (208) 800-0640 for Nevada coverage.
