## I-70: The Longest Serviceless Interstate Stretch in America

I-70 across central Utah holds a distinction no trucker wants to experience unprepared: the stretch from Salina to Green River is over 100 miles with zero services. No fuel. No food. No repair shops. No cell coverage through much of the San Rafael Swell. This is the longest gap between services on any US Interstate, and it is not a drill.

### What You Need to Know

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Serviceless stretch | Salina (MP 56) to Green River (MP 160+) |
| Distance | 100+ miles |
| Fuel availability | Salina (last westbound) / Green River (last eastbound) |
| Cell coverage | Spotty to nonexistent through San Rafael Swell |
| Truck parking | Extremely limited -- Salina and Green River only |
| Elevation | 4,000-7,000 feet, desert terrain |
| Speed limit | 75 mph (trucks), 80 mph (cars) |

### Fuel Planning

This cannot be overstated: **fuel up before entering I-70**. If you are eastbound, top off in Salina. If westbound, top off in Green River. There is nothing in between. A breakdown in the San Rafael Swell means waiting for a tow that may take hours to arrive, assuming you can get cell signal to call for one.

### Connection to Colorado

I-70 continues east into Colorado's mountain corridor with Eisenhower Tunnel (hazmat restrictions, chain law zone) and Vail Pass. [Colorado's I-70 mountain driving guide](/states/trucking-insurance-colorado/mountain-corridors/) covers the eastern continuation.

## I-80: Salt Flats, Parley's Canyon, and Echo

I-80 crosses Utah east to west, entering from Nevada at Wendover, passing through Salt Lake City, and exiting toward Wyoming through Echo Canyon. Each segment presents distinct challenges.

### Bonneville Salt Flats (Wendover to SLC)

The western approach from Nevada is deceptively dangerous. The Bonneville Salt Flats are flat and straight, which lulls drivers into complacency, but the hazards are real:

- **Wind exposure:** No windbreaks for miles. Crosswinds can push trailers without warning.
- **Extreme summer heat:** Surface temperatures exceed 120 degrees F. Tire blowout risk increases.
- **Limited services:** Very few stops between Wendover and the SLC metro area.
- **Mirage effect:** Heat shimmer creates visibility issues on summer afternoons.

### Parley's Canyon (SLC to Park City)

The most critical segment of I-80 in Utah. See the [Wasatch Chain Law Guide](/states/trucking-insurance-utah/chain-law/) for full details on chain requirements.

- **Variable speed limits:** 35-65 mph depending on conditions
- **Westbound truck limit:** 40 mph year-round
- **Ski season congestion:** November through April
- **Chain enforcement:** Most frequent in the state

### Echo Canyon (East of SLC toward Wyoming)

Echo Canyon carries I-80 and I-84 traffic northeast toward Wyoming and Idaho. Winter conditions include ice and wind. The Echo Port of Entry (I-80 WB) is located here and [issues oversize/overweight permits on site](/states/trucking-insurance-utah/permits-ports/).

## I-15: Arizona to Idaho Through the Wasatch Front

I-15 is Utah's north-south spine, running from St. George at the Arizona border through the entire Wasatch Front urban corridor to Tremonton near the Idaho border.

### Southern Segment: St. George to Provo

- **Desert terrain:** Hot summers, limited shade
- **Virgin River Gorge:** Technically in Arizona, but the approach through St. George is part of the Utah I-15 experience
- **St. George Port of Entry:** I-15 southbound, [issues permits on site](/states/trucking-insurance-utah/permits-ports/)
- **Elevation changes:** Sea level equivalent at St. George to 5,000+ feet approaching Cedar City

### Wasatch Front: Provo to Ogden

- **Heavy urban congestion:** Provo, Orem, Lehi, Salt Lake City, Bountiful, Ogden
- **I-15/I-80 interchange:** One of the busiest interchanges in the Mountain West
- **Construction:** Ongoing expansion projects
- **Truck parking:** 210-space Outpost facility near the I-15/I-80 area (verify current status)

### Northern Segment: Ogden to Tremonton

- **Transition zone:** Urban gives way to agricultural
- **I-84 junction:** Connects to Echo/Boise corridor
- **Perry Port of Entry:** Northern Utah weigh station

## I-84: Echo Junction to Idaho

I-84 branches from I-80 at Echo Junction and runs northwest through Ogden to Tremonton and Snowville, then into Idaho. This corridor connects Utah's I-80 traffic to I-86 and I-15 in Idaho.

- **Winter conditions:** Mountain weather through the northern Wasatch
- **Connection:** Links to [Idaho's I-84 corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/permits-ports/) and the Boise Port of Entry
- **Speed limit:** 75 mph rural, 65 mph urban

## Corridor Comparison

| Corridor | Utah Miles | Fuel Gap Risk | Chain Law Risk | Congestion Risk | Cell Coverage |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| I-70 | ~230 | EXTREME (100+ mi gap) | Low | Low | Poor |
| I-80 West (Salt Flats) | ~120 | High | Low | Low | Poor |
| I-80 East (Parley's) | ~60 | Low | HIGH | High (ski season) | Good |
| I-15 South | ~300 | Moderate | Low | Low | Moderate |
| I-15 Wasatch | ~90 | Low | Moderate | HIGH | Good |
| I-84 | ~100 | Low | Moderate | Low | Moderate |

## Truck Parking by Corridor

| Location | Corridor | Spaces | Diesel | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Outpost (SLC area) | I-15/I-80 | ~210 | Yes | Verify current status |
| Green River | I-70 | Limited | Yes | Only option for 100+ miles |
| Salina | I-70 | Limited | Yes | Last fuel before serviceless stretch |
| Wendover | I-80 | Moderate | Yes | Casino area, NV border |
| Tremonton | I-15/I-84 | Limited | Yes | Northern junction area |

## Cell Coverage Dead Zones

Download offline maps and GPS before entering these areas:

- **I-70 San Rafael Swell:** 50+ miles with no reliable signal
- **I-80 Bonneville Salt Flats:** Spotty from Wendover to ~40 miles east
- **Southern Utah canyons:** US-89, US-191, and secondary routes
- **I-84 northern mountains:** Intermittent through passes

## Speed Limits Reference

| Location | Cars | Trucks |
|----------|------|--------|
| Rural Interstate | 80 mph | 75 mph |
| Urban Interstate | 65 mph | 65 mph |
| Parley's Canyon (variable) | 35-65 mph | 35-65 mph (WB: 40 mph max) |
| US highways | 55-65 mph | 55-65 mph |

Planning a Utah corridor run? Whether it is Parley's Canyon in January or I-70 in July, make sure your coverage matches the route. [Wyoming I-80](/states/trucking-insurance-wyoming/) continues east from Echo, [Nevada I-80](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/) extends west from Wendover, and [Colorado I-70](/states/trucking-insurance-colorado/) picks up where Utah's desert stretch ends.
