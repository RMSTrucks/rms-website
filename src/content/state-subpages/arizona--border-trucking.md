## Mariposa Port of Entry

The Nogales-Mariposa Port of Entry is the primary commercial crossing between Arizona and Mexico. ALL commercial traffic now enters through Mariposa -- the Grand Avenue crossing no longer handles commercial vehicles.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Commercial Lanes | 8 inspection lanes |
| Facility Investment | $250 million renovation |
| Annual Produce Volume | 4+ billion lbs |
| Share of US Winter Produce | 45% |
| Connection | SR-189 to Mexican Federal Highway 15D |

## What Crosses Here

Nogales-Mariposa handles 45% of all winter produce entering the United States. The primary commodities:

- Fresh tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash
- Berries and tropical fruits
- Cut flowers
- Other temperature-sensitive agricultural products

This makes the crossing time-sensitive. Produce delays mean spoilage, and spoilage means cargo claims.

## I-19: Tucson to Border (63 Miles)

I-19 runs 63 miles from Tucson to the border. It is one of the few highways in America that uses kilometer markers instead of mile markers (a legacy of the metrication effort). Key stops:

- Tucson (I-10 interchange)
- Green Valley
- Tubac
- Nogales

## Insurance for Border Operations

Cross-border operations often carry additional insurance requirements:

- Mexican brokers and carriers may require higher liability limits
- Cargo insurance for produce should include temperature-sensitive coverage
- Physical damage coverage should account for the specific equipment (reefer units)
