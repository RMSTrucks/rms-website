## PA PUC Intrastate Authority

Carriers operating for-hire within Pennsylvania must obtain authority from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PA PUC). This is separate from federal FMCSA authority and applies to any carrier hauling goods or passengers for compensation within PA borders.

**Application requirements:**
- Filing fee: $100
- Processing time: 2-3 weeks
- Insurance filings: Form E (BI/PD liability) and Form H (cargo) must be submitted within 60 days of authority approval
- Vehicle marking: Company name in letters no less than 2 inches high by 1/2 inch wide, visible on both sides

**Penalties:** Operating without PA PUC authority carries a $1,000 per violation penalty. PUC enforcement officers work alongside State Police at weigh stations and inspection sites.

## PennDOT Oversize/Overweight Permits

PennDOT manages OS/OW permits through the APRAS (Automated Permit Routing and Analysis System) -- available 24/7 for registered account holders.

### Permit Fees

| Permit Type | Fee |
|---|---|
| Single-trip, under 14 ft wide | $46 |
| Single-trip, 14 ft wide or over | $97 |
| Overweight surcharge | $0.04 per ton-mile |
| PA Turnpike OS/OW (separate permit) | Contact Turnpike Operations |

### Operating Restrictions

- **Hours:** Sunrise to sunset, Monday through Friday
- **Saturday:** Sunrise to noon only
- **No movement:** Sundays, holidays, or during darkness
- **Pilot car required:** Height over 14 foot 6, length over 90 feet, or width over 12 feet
- **Winter restrictions:** No OS/OW movement during Tier 2+ winter restrictions

### PA Turnpike Permits

The PA Turnpike requires its own separate OS/OW permit, distinct from PennDOT APRAS permits. A PennDOT permit does NOT authorize oversize/overweight travel on the Turnpike. Contact the PA Turnpike Operations Center directly for Turnpike-specific permits.

## Posted and Bonded Roadways

Pennsylvania has an extensive system of weight-posted local roads. If you need to travel on a posted road with a vehicle exceeding the posted weight limit:

1. Obtain a PennDOT hauling permit
2. Post a surety bond with the local municipality for potential road damage
3. Bond amounts vary by municipality and road condition
4. Damage assessments are performed before and after hauling

Posted road maps are available through PennDOT District offices. The 511PA app shows posted roads in commercial vehicle mode.

## IRP and IFTA Registration

**International Registration Plan (IRP):**
- PA IRP registration expires May 31 annually
- Prorated by miles driven in each jurisdiction
- Cab card must be carried in the vehicle at all times

**International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA):**
- Quarterly filing required
- PA fuel tax rate adjusts periodically -- check current rate before filing
- License and decals must be displayed on both sides of the cab

## New Authority Carrier Checklist

If you are starting operations in Pennsylvania, budget for:

- Federal authority (MC number, USDOT number)
- PA PUC intrastate authority: $100
- Insurance filings (Form E, Form H): included in policy cost
- IRP registration: prorated by miles
- IFTA license: quarterly filing
- E-ZPass account: required for Turnpike operations
- Chains or ATDs: required to be on board during winter months
- Vehicle marking compliance: company name on both sides

:::tip
Do not start PA operations without PA PUC authority if you are hauling for-hire intrastate. The $1,000 per violation penalty is enforced, and PUC officers work at the same weigh stations and rest areas where State Police check credentials.
