| I-40 | Asheville to Raleigh | 65-70 mph |

## I-95: South Carolina to Virginia (182 Miles)

Flat, straight eastern NC. The monotonous terrain creates real fatigue risk on long-haul runs.

**Lumberton (MM 24):** Weigh stations near the [South Carolina border](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/corridors/). First checkpoint northbound.

**Fayetteville (MM 45-65):** Fort Liberty military base generates significant vehicle traffic on connecting highways. Expect convoy activity.

**Rocky Mount (MM 151.5):** Weigh stations. Speed transitions between 65 and 70 mph segments.

## I-85: South Carolina to Virginia (233 Miles)

The Piedmont corridor threads through Charlotte, the Triad, and Durham.

**Charlotte (MM 28):** The I-85 northbound weigh station sometimes closes when the truck queue backs onto the freeway during high-volume periods. If you see the queue extending onto the mainline, expect delays.

**Charlotte to Greensboro:** The I-85 corridor through the Piedmont carries heavy freight. Speed drops to 60 mph through Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) and Durham County.

## I-40: Tennessee to Wilmington (420 Miles)

**TN Border (MM 0-20):** Smoky Mountain grades continue from Tennessee. See the [mountain driving guide](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/mountain-driving/).

**Asheville (MM 40-55):** Blue Ridge mountain area with steep grades and curves. Weigh station at MM 40.5.

**Winston-Salem to Raleigh (MM 170-300):** Piedmont plateau. Moderate terrain with steady traffic growth.

**Wilmington (MM 420):** Port of Wilmington at the eastern terminus. Container traffic on the final approach.

## I-77: Charlotte to Virginia

**Express Lane Warning:** The I-77 Express Lanes in the [Charlotte area](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/charlotte-hub/) are PROHIBITED for vehicles with 3 or more axles. Use general-purpose lanes only.
