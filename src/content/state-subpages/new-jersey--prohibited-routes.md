## Garden State Parkway

The Garden State Parkway north of Exit 105 bans ALL commercial vehicles. This is not advisory -- it is physically enforced by 40+ low-clearance overpasses that will trap any truck that enters. Bridges as low as 10 feet 6 inches line the northern section. Even box trucks and large vans risk getting stuck.

South of Exit 105, trucks ARE permitted on the Garden State Parkway. The restriction applies only to the northern section.

**Penalty:** Fines plus towing costs plus bridge damage liability. Getting a truck stuck under a parkway bridge can cost tens of thousands of dollars.

## Palisades Interstate Parkway

The Palisades Interstate Parkway bans ALL commercial vehicles, trailers, rental trucks, and commercially-marked vehicles along its entire length. This parkway runs parallel to the Hudson River from the George Washington Bridge north into New York.

## The Parkway Rule

In New Jersey, if a road has "Parkway" in its name, assume trucks are banned. This simple rule prevents most routing errors.

## N.J.A.C. 16:32 Truck Route Hierarchy

New Jersey law establishes a three-tier routing hierarchy for large trucks (over 80,000 lbs GVW or 102 inches wide):

| Priority | Route Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | National Network | Interstate highways and designated federal routes |
| 2 | NJ Access Network | State highways connecting National Network to terminals |
| 3 | Local Unrestricted | Municipal roads without truck prohibitions |

Large trucks MUST stay on the National Network unless they need to access food, fuel, rest, repairs, or a terminal. When leaving the National Network, drivers must use the most direct route to their destination and return to the National Network by the most direct route.

## Municipal Through-Truck Bans

Many NJ municipalities have designated truck prohibition zones on local roads. These are typically residential streets or historic districts that cannot handle truck traffic. Signs are posted, but GPS systems frequently route trucks through these areas.

**Best practice:** Use a commercial GPS system or routing software that accounts for truck restrictions. Consumer GPS apps like Google Maps and Waze do NOT reliably filter truck-prohibited routes in NJ.

## What To Use Instead

- **North-south through NJ:** NJ Turnpike (I-95)
- **East-west northern NJ:** I-80 or I-78
- **NYC access:** George Washington Bridge (I-95), Lincoln Tunnel (NJ Route 495), or Goethals/Bayonne/Outerbridge (I-278/NJ 440)
- **South Jersey:** I-295 or NJ Turnpike southern section

:::tip
Program your GPS to avoid parkways before entering New Jersey. One wrong turn onto the Garden State Parkway north of Exit 105 can cost hours of delay and thousands in damage if you hit a low bridge.
