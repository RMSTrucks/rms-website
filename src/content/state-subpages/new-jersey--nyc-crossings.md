## Crossing Comparison

Every NYC crossing from New Jersey has different restrictions. Choosing the wrong one can result in being turned around, fined, or stuck.

| Crossing | Height Limit | Width Limit | Tractor-Trailers | Hazmat | 5-Axle Toll (E-ZPass) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| George Washington Bridge | No posted limit | No posted limit | All permitted | Most classes | ~$34 peak / ~$28 off-peak |
| Lincoln Tunnel | 13 ft 0 in | 8 ft 6 in | Permitted (not center tube) | Most prohibited | ~$34 peak / ~$28 off-peak |
| Holland Tunnel | 12 ft 6 in | 8 ft 0 in | BANNED (3+ axles) | All prohibited | ~$34 peak / ~$28 off-peak |

| Outerbridge Crossing | No posted limit | No posted limit | All permitted | Most classes | ~$34 peak / ~$28 off-peak |

## George Washington Bridge

The GWB is the most truck-friendly NYC crossing from NJ. All truck types are permitted. The lower level (I-95) is preferred for trucks -- the upper level carries most passenger traffic. The bridge connects I-95 in NJ to I-95/Cross Bronx Expressway in New York.

**Access:** NJ Turnpike Exit 18W or I-80 East to I-95 North.

## Lincoln Tunnel

The Lincoln Tunnel has three tubes. Trucks are permitted in the north and south tubes but NOT the center tube. Height is limited to 13 feet 0 inches and width to 8 feet 6 inches. Most hazmat classes are prohibited.

**Access:** NJ Route 495 from NJ Turnpike Exit 16W or I-95.

## Holland Tunnel

The Holland Tunnel bans ALL trucks with more than 3 axles. Only 2-axle and 3-axle single-unit trucks are permitted, with a 12 foot 6 inch height limit and 8 foot 0 inch width limit. All hazmat is prohibited. GPS systems routinely direct trucks to the Holland Tunnel -- do NOT follow GPS blindly on I-78 East approaching the tunnel.

**Consequence of entering:** You cannot turn around inside the tunnel. Oversized vehicles that enter are extracted by PANYNJ at the vehicle owner expense.

## Goethals Bridge, Bayonne Bridge, and Outerbridge Crossing

These three Staten Island crossings are the workhorses for port and Brooklyn/Queens-bound freight. All permit tractor-trailers and most hazmat classes.

- **Goethals Bridge:** I-278/NJ Turnpike Exit 13. Key route from NJ to Staten Island and Brooklyn via I-278.
- **Bayonne Bridge:** NJ 440. Recently raised clearance eliminated previous height restrictions.
- **Outerbridge Crossing:** NJ 440 from Perth Amboy to Staten Island.

## Port Authority Toll Rates (2026)

All Port Authority crossings use the same toll schedule. Peak hours are weekdays 6-10 AM and 4-8 PM.

| Axles | Peak E-ZPass | Off-Peak E-ZPass | Toll By Mail |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | ~$17 | ~$13 | ~$19 |
| 3 | ~$25 | ~$21 | ~$28 |
| 4 | ~$30 | ~$25 | ~$33 |
| 5 | ~$34 | ~$28 | ~$38 |
| 6+ | ~$38 | ~$32 | ~$42 |

:::tip
The Holland Tunnel trap is real. Every week, trucks follow GPS onto I-78 East and end up at the Holland Tunnel entrance with no legal way through. Know which crossing you need BEFORE you enter the approach roads.
