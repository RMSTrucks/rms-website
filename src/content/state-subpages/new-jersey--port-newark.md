## Terminal Access

Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal is one of the busiest container ports on the East Coast. Access requires knowing the correct NJ Turnpike exit for your specific terminal.

| Terminal | NJ Turnpike Exit | Gate Street | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Port Newark (general) | Exit 14 | Calcutta Street | Main port area |
| APM Terminal/Elizabeth | Exit 13A | Tyler Street | Container terminal |
| Maher Terminals | Exit 14 | Via Port Street | Container operations |

## Primary Routes

**From the NJ Turnpike (north or south):**
- Exit 14 for Port Newark terminals
- Exit 13A for APM Terminal and Elizabeth-side operations
- Follow port access signs from the exit ramp

**From I-78 (west):**
- I-78 East to NJ Turnpike Exit 14 interchange
- Follow Doremus Avenue for direct port access

**From I-95/GWB (north):**
- NJ Turnpike South to Exit 14
- Or I-78 West to designated port access roads

## Doremus Avenue Overweight Route

The Doremus Avenue corridor is designated as an overweight route for marine containerized cargo. Vehicles carrying marine containers can operate up to 128,000 lbs Maximum Gross Vehicle Weight on this route -- significantly above the standard 80,000 lb federal limit.

**Requirements:**
- Must be carrying marine containerized cargo
- Must use the designated Doremus Avenue route
- Standard OS/OW permits are NOT required for this specific overweight corridor
- The 128,000 lb limit applies ONLY on the designated route

## Port Operations Tips

- **Arrive during off-peak hours** when possible. Gate congestion during morning rush (7-9 AM) can add 60+ minutes to your terminal time.
- **Chassis availability** varies by terminal. Check chassis pool status before arriving.
- **TWIC card required** for unescorted access to port secure areas.
- **Truck parking** near the port is extremely limited. Do not plan to park at the port overnight -- use designated truck stops along the NJ Turnpike.

## Connecting to Other Ports

Port Newark-Elizabeth connects to the broader East Coast port network:
- **Port of Baltimore:** NJ Turnpike South to I-95 South through Delaware and Maryland
- **Port of Wilmington (DE):** NJ Turnpike South, cross Delaware Memorial Bridge, I-495 Exit 2
- **Brooklyn/Red Hook Terminal:** Goethals Bridge to I-278

:::tip
The Doremus Avenue 128,000 lb overweight corridor is a significant advantage for port truckers moving heavy containers. Make sure your route stays on the designated corridor -- exceeding 80,000 lbs on any other NJ road without a permit results in heavy fines.
