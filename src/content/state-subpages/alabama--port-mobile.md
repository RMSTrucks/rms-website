## Port of Mobile Overview

The Port of Mobile sits at the convergence of I-65 and I-10 on the northern Gulf Coast, handling container cargo, bulk commodities, and a growing volume of chemical and petroleum imports. The port has been expanding capacity steadily, and that expansion translates directly into more drayage traffic on surrounding highways.

Mobile is the only deepwater port in Alabama. Container terminal operations are growing as shippers look for alternatives to congested Gulf ports in Houston and New Orleans. The chemical and petroleum imports that come through Mobile create significant hazmat truck traffic along the I-10 and I-65 corridors, which means carriers serving this port need to carry appropriate hazmat endorsements and coverage.

## Getting to the Port

The primary access routes funnel through two corridors:

| Route | Direction | Key Details |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| I-65 Southbound | From Birmingham/Montgomery | 367 miles from TN border, flat and straight south of Montgomery |
| I-10 Eastbound | From Mississippi/Louisiana | 66 miles across southern Alabama, shortest I-10 segment in any state |
| I-10 Westbound | From Florida Panhandle | Crosses Mobile Bay via Jubilee Parkway toll bridge |
| US-98/US-90 | Local access | Surface routes connecting to terminal gates |

The I-65/I-10 interchange in Mobile is the critical junction. Southbound I-65 traffic heading to the port merges with east-west I-10 traffic in an area that gets congested during shift changes and peak container pickup hours.

## George Wallace Tunnel

The George Wallace Tunnel carries I-10 under the Mobile River in downtown Mobile. This tunnel has restrictions that affect commercial traffic:

- Height restrictions apply -- verify current clearance before routing through
- Hazmat restrictions on certain cargo classes during peak hours
- High-traffic periods create significant delays, especially during cruise ship arrivals and port shift changes
- The Bankhead Tunnel (US-98) is an alternative but has tighter clearance

When the tunnel is backed up, I-10 traffic stacks on both approaches. During major delays, some carriers route around via I-165 to US-90/US-98 to avoid the tunnel entirely.

## Chemical and Petroleum Hauling

Mobile handles substantial chemical and petroleum imports, making it a hub for hazmat trucking on the Gulf Coast. Carriers hauling from the port need:

- Proper hazmat endorsements on CDL
- Cargo insurance limits matching the commodity -- petroleum carriers typically need $1,000,000 minimum
- Familiarity with port security protocols, including TWIC card requirements for unescorted access to secure areas
- Knowledge of designated hazmat routes out of the port area

The chemical corridor extends along I-65 north toward Birmingham and along I-10 east toward Pensacola. Refineries and chemical plants along this corridor generate consistent freight demand.

## Insurance Considerations for Port Operations

Drayage and port-serving carriers face specific coverage needs:

| Coverage | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|
| Auto Liability ($1M CSL) | Port area congestion and hazmat exposure increase risk |
| Cargo Insurance | Container freight values vary widely; verify adequate limits |
| Hazmat Coverage | Required for chemical/petroleum hauling from port terminals |
| Physical Damage | Port yard damage from tight maneuvering is common |
| General Liability | Terminal operations expose you to third-party property claims |

RMS recommends contacting us at (208) 800-0640 for port-specific coverage packages. Drayage operations have different risk profiles than long-haul, and your policy should reflect that.

## Truck Parking Near the Port

Truck parking in the Mobile area concentrates along the I-65 corridor north of the port and along I-10 in both directions:

- I-65 rest areas north of Mobile provide overnight options but fill during peak periods
- Commercial truck stops cluster near the I-65/I-10 interchange
- Port staging areas may have limited waiting space -- confirm with your dispatcher
- The Jubilee Parkway (I-10 eastbound over Mobile Bay) has no stopping or parking

## Seasonal Considerations

- **Hurricane season (June-November):** Mobile is on the Gulf Coast and vulnerable to tropical weather. Port operations may shut down during storms, and I-10 can be closed for storm surge or debris.
- **Fog:** Mobile Bay fog can affect visibility on the Jubilee Parkway and tunnel approaches, particularly in winter mornings.
- **Summer heat:** Containerized cargo sitting in the sun can create temperature-related claims. Reefer operations need reliable equipment.

The Port of Mobile connects to the broader Alabama corridor network. Carriers running I-65 north to Tennessee or I-10 east to Florida should review the [Alabama Interstate Corridor Guide](/states/trucking-insurance-alabama/corridors/) for mile-by-mile details. For coverage questions specific to port operations, call RMS at (208) 800-0640.
