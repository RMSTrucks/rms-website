## 306 Miles: Council Bluffs to the Quad Cities

I-80 crosses Iowa from Council Bluffs (Omaha) on the west to Davenport (Quad Cities) on the east -- 306 miles of corridor anchored by the world's largest truck stop. Des Moines sits near the midpoint where I-80 intersects I-35. No tolls. Rest areas every 30 minutes. Over 2,300 truck parking spots between Des Moines and Davenport. Compared to I-80 through Nebraska to the west or Illinois to the east, Iowa is the easy section.

## Iowa 80: The World's Largest Truck Stop

Iowa 80 at Walcott (Exit 284) is more than a fuel stop. It is a landmark, a destination, and a safety valve for I-80 parking pressure.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Location | I-80 Exit 284, Walcott, Iowa |
| Parking spaces | 900+ |
| Fuel lanes | 20+ diesel lanes |
| Restaurant | Full-service sit-down dining |
| Amenities | Truck wash, barber, cinema, dentist, chiropractor, fitness center |
| Repair | Full-service shop, tire center |
| Store | One of the largest trucking supply stores in the US |

Iowa 80 rarely fills completely because of the sheer number of spaces. When rest areas along I-80 are full, Iowa 80 at Walcott is the reliable fallback. It sits 80 miles east of Des Moines and 80 miles west of the Illinois border.

## Segment Guide

### Council Bluffs to Des Moines (MM 0-124)

| Feature | Mile Marker | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Missouri River crossing | MM 0-3 | Omaha/Council Bluffs bridge, construction zones |
| Avoca weigh station | WB MP 44 | Westbound |
| I-80/I-35 interchange | MM 124-137 | Des Moines metro, highest Iowa I-80 traffic |

The Council Bluffs/Omaha bridge area frequently has construction. I-80 through this section crosses the Missouri River and navigates interchange sequences with I-29 and I-480. Traffic gets heavy in the Des Moines metro where I-80 and I-35 intersect.

### Des Moines Metro (MM 124-145)

| Feature | Mile Marker | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Dallas station | EB MP 115 | Eastbound, west side of Des Moines |
| I-35 interchange | MM 124-137 | Complex merge, highest volumes |
| Jasper station | WB MP 150.75 | Westbound, east side of Des Moines |

:::tip
The Dallas (EB MP 115) and Jasper (WB MP 150.75) stations bracket Des Moines. Both directions are actively staffed. If you are running legal, these are routine stops. Drivewyze and PrePass bypass is available.
:::

Des Moines is the traffic pinch point on Iowa I-80. The I-80/I-35 interchange sees the highest truck volumes in the state. Rush hour (7-9 AM, 4-6 PM) adds congestion. If possible, transit Des Moines during off-peak hours.

### Des Moines to Iowa 80 (MM 145-284)

| Feature | Mile Marker | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Grinnell | MM 182 | Small city, limited truck services |
| Cedar station | WB MP 268.5 | Westbound |
| Iowa City | MM 239-246 | University of Iowa, game day traffic in fall |
| Walcott / Iowa 80 | Exit 284 | World's largest truck stop, 900+ spaces |

This section has 2,300+ truck parking spots when you include rest areas, commercial truck stops, and Iowa 80 itself. This is the best-served stretch of I-80 between Chicago and Omaha.

### Iowa 80 to Quad Cities (MM 284-306)

| Feature | Mile Marker | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Davenport | MM 292-298 | Quad Cities metro, I-74 interchange |
| Mississippi River crossing | MM 306 | Illinois border |

The final 22 miles from Iowa 80 to the Quad Cities and the Illinois border are straightforward. The Mississippi River crossing at Davenport takes you into Illinois.

## Weigh Stations

| Station | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |

## Truck Parking

Iowa I-80 has some of the best truck parking density in the country:

| Segment | Parking Availability |
|---------|---------------------|
| Council Bluffs (Omaha) area | Multiple truck stops, moderate |
| Council Bluffs to Des Moines | Rest areas every 30 min, moderate |
| Des Moines metro | Can overflow during peak; multiple truck stops |
| Des Moines to Iowa 80 | Excellent -- rest areas + truck stops + Iowa 80 |
| Iowa 80 to Quad Cities | Good -- truck stops near Davenport |

Iowa DOT opens overflow parking lots during peak periods at select rest areas. The 511 travel information system includes live parking counts for some rest areas. Iowa participates in the TPIMS (Truck Parking Information Management System) program.

## No Tolls

I-80 through Iowa is completely free. When you cross into Illinois at the Mississippi River, I-80 through Illinois is also toll-free (the toll roads are on I-90, I-88, and I-294/355). When you cross west into Nebraska at Council Bluffs, I-80 through Nebraska is also toll-free. The nearest tolled road is the Kansas Turnpike, 200+ miles to the south.

## Weather

- **Winter (November-March):** Snow, ice, and wind. Iowa DOT maintains I-80 aggressively, but blowing snow across open terrain reduces visibility. Bridge icing is the primary hazard.
- **Spring (March-May):** Spring thaw restrictions on secondary roads (see [Iowa Spring Thaw Restrictions](/states/trucking-insurance-iowa/spring-thaw/)). I-80 itself is not subject to spring restrictions.
- **Summer:** Severe thunderstorms possible. Heavy agricultural equipment on side roads during harvest.
