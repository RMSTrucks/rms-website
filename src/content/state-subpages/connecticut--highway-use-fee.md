## Who Pays

Every vehicle with a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 lbs or more operating on ANY Connecticut highway must pay the Highway Use Fee. This includes interstate carriers passing through CT on I-95, I-84, or I-91 -- even if you never stop in the state.

## Rate Table

| Weight Range (GVW) | Rate Per Mile |
|---|---|
| 26,000 - 28,000 lbs | \$0.025 |
| 28,001 - 36,000 lbs | \$0.050 |
| 36,001 - 54,000 lbs | \$0.075 |
| 54,001 - 60,000 lbs | \$0.100 |
| 60,001 - 68,000 lbs | \$0.125 |
| 68,001 - 80,000 lbs | \$0.150 |
| Over 80,000 lbs | \$0.175 |

## Practical Cost Examples

| Scenario | GVW | CT Miles | HUF Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single I-95 crossing (NY to RI) | 80,000 lbs | ~112 miles | ~$16.80 |
| I-84 crossing (NY to MA) | 80,000 lbs | ~98 miles | ~$14.70 |
| Weekly I-95 round trip | 80,000 lbs | ~224 miles | ~$33.60 |
| Annual (weekly I-95 round trips) | 80,000 lbs | ~11,648 miles | ~$1,747 |

## Registration and Filing

**Before your first CT mile:**
1. Register with the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services (CT DRS)
2. Obtain a HUF account through the myconneCT portal (myconneCT.ct.gov)

**Quarterly filing:**
- File through the myconneCT portal
- Due dates: April 30, July 31, October 31, January 31
- You MUST file every quarter, even if you drove zero miles in CT
- Failure to file zero-mile returns results in penalties

**Record keeping:**
- Maintain mileage records for a minimum of 4 years
- Records are subject to CT DRS audit
- GPS/ELD data is acceptable documentation

## How It Compares

The Highway Use Fee is simpler than some other state mileage taxes:

| State | Tax Type | Rate Range | Filing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Connecticut | Highway Use Fee | \$0.025-\$0.175/mile | Quarterly |
| New Mexico | Weight-Distance Tax | \$0.021-\$0.126/mile | Monthly |
| Kentucky | KYU | \$0.0285/mile | Monthly |
| Oregon | Weight-Mile Tax | \$0.0163-\$0.2589/mile | Monthly |

CT filing is quarterly (changed from monthly in late 2023), which reduces administrative burden compared to monthly-filing states.

:::tip
The Highway Use Fee catches many carriers by surprise -- there are no toll booths or collection points. You owe the fee based on miles driven and must self-report quarterly. Set up your myconneCT account before your first CT trip to avoid compliance issues.
