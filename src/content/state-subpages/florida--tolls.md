## Florida Toll Basics

Florida is one of the most toll-intensive states for commercial trucking. A multi-stop Florida run can rack up 50 to 100 dollars per day in tolls. One transponder -- SunPass -- works everywhere in the state. E-ZPass also works on all Florida toll roads. But there are traps.

## Transponder Options

| Transponder | Works in Florida | Works in Other States | Notes |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------|
| **SunPass Mini** | All FL toll roads | No | 4.99, sticker-style, FL only |
| **SunPass PRO** | All FL toll roads | 23 E-ZPass states | 14.99, portable, best for interstate carriers |
| **E-ZPass** | All FL toll roads | 19 states | Works in FL, but NOT in express lanes |

### The Express Lane Trap

I-4 Express Lanes and I-95 Express Lanes in South Florida require SunPass. E-ZPass will not work in these lanes.

:::tip
Do NOT run both a SunPass and an E-ZPass transponder in the same vehicle. The systems will both attempt to charge, resulting in double billing.
:::

## Alligator Alley (I-75, SR 84)

80 miles crossing the Everglades. No services, no exits, no shoulders in many sections.

| Axle Count | SunPass | Cash/Toll-By-Plate |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 2-axle | 3.50 | 3.50 |
| 3-axle | 7.00 | 8.75 |
| 4-axle | 9.50 | 11.90 |
| 5-axle | 12.72 | 15.90 |
| 6-axle | 15.25 | 19.05 |

:::tip
Alligator Alley has NO services for 80 miles. Full fuel, full water before you enter. Fog events close the road with little warning.
:::

## I-4 Express Lanes

Dynamic pricing between Tampa and Orlando. SunPass only. Range: 0.50 off-peak to 5.00+ peak.

## I-95 Express Lanes (South Florida)

Dynamic pricing through Broward and Miami-Dade. Range: 0.50 to 10.50+ based on congestion. SunPass required.

## Other Major Toll Roads

| Facility | Region | Typical 5-Axle Toll |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Florida Turnpike (full length) | Statewide | 45-55 |
| Sawgrass Expressway | Fort Lauderdale | 3-8 per segment |
| SR 528 (Bee Line) | Orlando to coast | 5-12 |
| SR 429 (Western Beltway) | Orlando west | 4-10 |
| Veterans Expressway | Tampa | 3-8 |

## Daily Toll Cost Estimates

| Operation Type | Daily Toll Estimate |
|---------------|--------------------|
| South FL local | 30-75 |
| Central FL local (Orlando) | 20-50 |
| Tampa Bay local | 15-40 |
| Long-haul through FL (Turnpike) | 45-75 per trip |
| Multi-stop FL run | 50-100 per day |

## Money-Saving Strategies

1. **Get SunPass PRO.** One device covers Florida and 23 E-ZPass states.
2. **Use the Turnpike instead of I-95 when time allows.** Fewer trucks, more predictable travel times.
3. **Avoid express lanes unless the time savings justifies the dynamic price.**
4. **Track toll spending as a deductible expense.**
5. **Plan Alligator Alley crossings for early morning.** Less traffic, lower fog risk.
