## ODOT Online Permit System

Ohio processes oversize/overweight permits through the online portal at [haulingpermits.transportation.ohio.gov](https://haulingpermits.transportation.ohio.gov). Standard permits cost approximately $135, with costs increasing for superloads that require routing analysis and escort coordination.

### What You Need

- Vehicle and load dimensions (length, width, height)
- Weight per axle and gross weight
- Axle configuration and spacing
- Origin and destination addresses
- Proposed route
- Proof of insurance
- Former OHPass users must claim their accounts in the new system

## Weight Limits and Permitted Maximums

### Standard Legal Limits

| Configuration | Standard Limit |
|--------------|----------------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lbs |
| Tridem axle | 48,000 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000 lbs |

### Permitted Maximums

| Configuration | Permitted Max |
|--------------|---------------|
| Single axle | 29,000 lbs |
| Short tandem | 36,000 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000+ lbs (with proper axle spacing) |

The Federal Bridge Formula is enforced statewide. Permitted loads must comply with bridge formula requirements for their specific axle spacing.

## Dual Permit System: ODOT + Turnpike

This is the most important detail for haulers running oversize/overweight through Ohio: **the Ohio Turnpike requires a SEPARATE permit from ODOT permits.** An ODOT hauling permit does not authorize travel on the Turnpike, and a Turnpike permit does not cover state highways.

If your route crosses both systems, you need both permits. Contact:
- **ODOT:** [haulingpermits.transportation.ohio.gov](https://haulingpermits.transportation.ohio.gov)
- **Ohio Turnpike Commission:** Separate application process

## Dimension Limits

| Dimension | Standard | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Height | 13.6 ft | Bridge clearances vary -- verify route |
| Width | 8.5 ft | On designated routes |
| Single trailer length | 53 ft | Standard kingpin-to-rear limit |

## Superloads

Loads exceeding standard permitted maximums are classified as superloads and require:
- Detailed routing analysis by ODOT
- Bridge engineering review for the proposed route
- Escort vehicle requirements (pilot cars, law enforcement)
- Additional permit fees
- Movement timing restrictions

## Seasonal Considerations

Ohio does not have formal spring thaw restrictions on state highways. However, OSHP runs seasonal enforcement blitzes during spring thaw targeting grain and coal trucks. County roads may have seasonal weight postings. Check with local authorities if your OSOW route includes non-state roads.
