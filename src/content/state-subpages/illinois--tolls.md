## Chicago Skyway (I-90)

The Chicago Skyway is a privately-operated toll bridge connecting the Dan Ryan Expressway (I-90/94) in Chicago to the Indiana Toll Road at the state line. It is the most expensive single toll point for trucks in the Midwest, and the rates increase every year under a long-term concession contract.

### 2025-2026 Skyway Rates

| Vehicle Class | Peak Rate | Off-Peak Rate |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2-axle | $6.00 | $4.40 |
| 3-axle | $12.10 | $8.70 |
| 4-axle | $18.20 | $12.90 |
| 5-axle | $45.40 | $32.40 |
| 6+ axle | $54.50 | $38.80 |

**2026 update:** Rates are climbing above $66 for some configurations under the annual contractual escalation. E-ZPass is mandatory -- there are no cash lanes on the Skyway.

### Key Facts

- Peak hours vary but generally align with weekday commute times
- No cash lanes -- E-ZPass only
- Annual rate increases are contractual and guaranteed
- The Skyway connects directly to the Indiana Toll Road, so budget for both tolls on east-west runs

## Illinois Tollway System

The Illinois Tollway operates 7 roads covering 294 miles across the Chicago metro area. Unlike the Skyway, the Tollway offers significant discounts for transponder users.

### Tollway Roads

| Road | Route | Key Corridor |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Jane Addams Memorial (I-90) | Chicago to Rockford | Northwest suburbs to WI border |
| Tri-State (I-294) | South suburbs to north suburbs | Western bypass around Chicago |
| Reagan Memorial (I-88) | Hillside to Rock Falls | East-west suburban corridor |
| Veterans Memorial (I-355) | I-55 to I-290 | North-south suburban connector |
| Elgin-O'Hare (IL 390) | Elgin to O'Hare area | Airport freight access |
| Illinois Route 390 | Lake Street to I-290 | Western suburbs connector |
| I-490 | O'Hare Western Bypass | Under construction |

### I-PASS vs Pay By Plate

| Payment Method | Discount | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-------|
| I-PASS / E-ZPass | ~50% off | Compatible across 19 states |
| Pay By Plate | Full rate | Billed to registered address |
| Unpaid / Missed | Full rate + penalties | Escalates quickly |

Truck toll rates on the Tollway range from $0.50 to $18.30 per plaza depending on the road and axle count. Daytime rates (6 AM - 10 PM) are higher than overnight rates (10 PM - 6 AM). Passenger vehicle tolls have been frozen at 2012 levels, but truck tolls increase annually.

## Cost Planning

For a 5-axle truck running from Indiana to I-90 through Chicago:
- Skyway: $45.40 peak / $32.40 off-peak
- Tollway I-90 (Jane Addams): varies by distance, typically $8-15 with I-PASS
- Tollway I-294 (Tri-State): $10-18 with I-PASS

A single round trip through Chicago can cost $100+ in tolls for a 5-axle truck. Weekly regulars are looking at $500+ per week in toll costs alone. Factor this into load pricing.
