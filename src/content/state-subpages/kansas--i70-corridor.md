## 424 Miles from Kansas City to Colorado

I-70 crosses the entire state of Kansas from east to west -- 424 miles from the Missouri border at Kansas City to the Colorado border at Kanorado. The eastern half is manageable. The western half, from Salina to the Colorado line, is one of the most wind-exposed trucking corridors in the United States.

## Segment Breakdown

### Kansas City Metro to Topeka (MM 424 to MM 358)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | 66 miles |
| Terrain | Urban/suburban, rolling |
| Traffic | Heavy KC metro, moderate after Lawrence |
| Hazards | KC interchange complexity, Topeka construction |
| Services | Abundant |

The KC metro I-70 section involves multiple interchange sequences with I-35, I-435, US-71 (I-49), and I-635. Through-traffic should use I-435 to bypass downtown KC unless delivering to the metro area. Topeka has active construction zones -- check KDOT for current lane closures.

### Topeka to Salina (MM 358 to MM 252)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | 106 miles |
| Terrain | Flint Hills, gently rolling |
| Traffic | Moderate |
| Hazards | Crosswinds in Flint Hills, burning season smoke |
| Weigh stations | Wabaunsee (MP 329.5 EB/WB) |

The Flint Hills section is scenic and generally manageable. The Wabaunsee weigh stations (both directions at MP 329.5) are the primary enforcement point on I-70. During spring burning season (March-April), controlled burns in the Flint Hills can create smoke that reduces visibility dramatically.

### Salina to Hays (MM 252 to MM 159)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | 93 miles |
| Terrain | Flat, open prairie |
| Traffic | Light to moderate |
| Hazards | Wind exposure increases, longer service gaps |
| Services | Salina cluster, Hays cluster, Russell (limited) |

Salina is the last major service cluster before the corridor opens up. The I-70/I-135 interchange at Salina is a busy merge point. West of Salina, service gaps get longer and wind exposure increases.

### Hays to Colby (MM 159 to MM 53)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | 106 miles |
| Terrain | Flat, completely exposed |
| Traffic | Light |
| Hazards | **Severe crosswinds (50+ mph), cell coverage gaps** |
| Services | Hays, WaKeeney (limited), Oakley (limited), Colby |

:::tip
This is the danger zone. Crosswinds routinely exceed 50 mph between Hays and Colby. Empty trailers and high-profile vehicles are at serious risk of being blown over. KDOT may close this section during severe wind or winter weather events. If wind advisories are active, park and wait.
:::

Cell coverage drops out in this section. You may lose signal for extended stretches between WaKeeney and Oakley. Download offline maps and have a CB radio as backup.

### Colby to Colorado Border (MM 53 to MM 0)

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Distance | 53 miles |
| Terrain | High plains, slight elevation gain |
| Traffic | Light |
| Hazards | Wind, winter storms, cell dead zones |
| Weigh station | Kanorado (EB MP 0.5) at Colorado border |
| Services | Colby, Goodland, Kanorado (minimal) |

The final 53 miles to Kanorado and the Colorado border remain wind-exposed and remote. The Kanorado weigh station catches eastbound traffic entering Kansas from Colorado. Cell coverage is unreliable throughout this section.

## Wind Hazards

Western Kansas wind is not an occasional problem -- it is a defining characteristic of the corridor. Key facts:

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Wind gusts | Routinely exceed 50 mph |
| Worst months | March, April, November, December |
| Risk vehicles | Empty trailers, reefer units, flatbeds with light loads |
| KDOT response | May close I-70 sections during severe events |
| Best defense | Park and wait when wind advisories are active |

Wind-related rollovers on I-70 in western Kansas are not rare events. They happen multiple times per year. If you are running empty or light, take wind advisories seriously. Pulling off at Hays or Salina until conditions improve is the smart play.

## Weigh Stations

| Station | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Station 5A | KC area | WB | Westbound entering from Missouri |
| Wabaunsee 21W | MP 329.5 | WB | Flint Hills, primary I-70 station |
| Wabaunsee 22W | MP 329.5 | EB | Flint Hills, primary I-70 station |
| Kanorado 46 | MP 0.5 | EB | Colorado border, eastbound |

All CMVs must stop at open stations. PrePass and Drivewyze are available, but oversize/overweight loads must still enter even with a green PrePass signal.

## Cell Coverage Map

| Segment | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| KC to Topeka | Good (all carriers) |
| Topeka to Salina | Good (all carriers) |
| Salina to Hays | Generally good, occasional drops |
| Hays to Colby | **Weak to nonexistent** |
| Colby to Colorado | **Weak to nonexistent** |

Download offline maps for the Hays-to-Colorado stretch. If you need to make an emergency call, look for exits near small towns where tower coverage is better.

## Truck Parking and Services

| Location | Type | Approximate Spaces |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| KC metro | Multiple truck stops | 500+ |
| Topeka | Truck stops at I-70/I-335 junction | 100+ |
| Salina | Major truck stop cluster | 200+ |
| Hays | Truck stop cluster | 100+ |
| Colby | Truck stops | 50+ |
| Goodland | Limited | 20-30 |

KDOT operates the TPIMS system at tpims.ksdot.gov, providing real-time truck parking data for I-70 and I-135 rest areas. Check availability before planning your stop, especially in western Kansas where options are limited.

## Seasonal Hazards

### Winter (November-March)
- Blizzards and ground blizzards can close I-70 from Salina west
- Ice storms affect the entire corridor
- KDOT plows aggressively but cannot keep up with major events
- Western Kansas closures can last 24-48 hours

### Spring (March-May)
- Flint Hills controlled burn season creates smoke that reduces visibility
- Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes possible
- Wind events continue through spring

### Summer
- Heat advisories can affect tire performance on long western Kansas stretches
- Occasional severe thunderstorms with hail

The I-70 Kansas corridor connects to [I-70 Missouri](/states/trucking-insurance-missouri/i70-corridor/) to the east and I-70 Colorado to the west. For trucking insurance on the I-70 corridor, contact RMS at (208) 800-0640.
