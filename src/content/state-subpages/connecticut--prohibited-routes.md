## Merritt Parkway

The Merritt Parkway (Route 15) is completely closed to all commercial vehicles. The restrictions are absolute:

| Restriction | Limit |
|---|---|
| Maximum GVW | 7,500 lbs |
| Maximum Height | 8 ft 0 in |
| Maximum Length | 24 ft |
| Maximum Width | 7 ft 6 in |
| Trailers | ALL prohibited |
| Rental Trucks | ALL prohibited |
| RVs | ALL prohibited |
| Commercially-marked vehicles | Subject to enforcement |

The Merritt Parkway has 40+ low-clearance historic overpasses. These bridges are architectural landmarks and will NOT be raised. A standard tractor-trailer at 13 foot 6 inches will not clear an 8-foot bridge.

### What Happens If You Enter

Trucks that enter the Merritt Parkway get stuck under bridges. This results in:
- Multi-hour traffic closures
- Towing fees (specialized equipment required)
- Bridge damage liability (potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars)
- Criminal citations
- News coverage (your company name on the local news)

## Wilbur Cross Parkway

The Wilbur Cross Parkway is the northern extension of the Merritt Parkway with similar restrictions. Same height limits, same truck bans, same low-clearance bridges. Treat the entire Route 15 corridor as truck-prohibited.

## CTDOT OSTA Through-Truck Bans

Many Connecticut municipalities have established through-truck prohibition zones through the CTDOT Office of State Traffic Administration (OSTA). These bans typically cover residential streets and historic areas where truck traffic causes damage or safety concerns.

**How they work:**
- Signs posted at zone boundaries
- Trucks may enter the zone ONLY for local pickups or deliveries
- Through-traffic must use state highways or interstates
- Enforcement by local police

Check the CTDOT OSTA website for a list of municipalities with active through-truck prohibitions.

## What to Use Instead

The Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways run parallel to I-95 from Greenwich to Milford. For truck routing through Connecticut:

| Origin/Destination | Use This Route |
|---|---|
| NYC to New England (coastal) | I-95 |
| NYC to Hartford | I-95 to I-91 North, or I-84 East |
| Western CT | I-84 |
| Eastern CT | I-395 from I-95 |

:::tip
GPS navigation apps frequently suggest the Merritt Parkway as a faster route parallel to I-95. Override this suggestion every time. Consumer GPS does not reliably filter truck-prohibited routes in Connecticut.
