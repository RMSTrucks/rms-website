## When NDOT Closes I-80

Nebraska does not wait for accidents to happen. When severe winter storms hit western Nebraska, NDOT and the State Patrol proactively close I-80 sections. These are not suggestions -- they are enforced closures with gates and patrol cars blocking access.

### Closure Patterns

| Section | Closure Frequency | Typical Duration |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Kearney to North Platte | Several times per winter | 12-36 hours |
| North Platte to Ogallala | Multiple times per winter | 12-48 hours |
| Ogallala to Wyoming | Most frequent | 24-72+ hours |

Western Nebraska from Kearney to Wyoming is the most closure-prone section of I-80 in the entire country. The flat, open terrain offers no windbreak, and blowing snow creates zero-visibility conditions that no amount of careful driving can overcome.

### What Triggers a Closure

- Sustained winds exceeding 40 mph combined with snow
- Visibility below 500 feet due to blowing/drifting snow
- Ground blizzard conditions (snow may not be falling, but wind blows existing snow into whiteout)
- Multiple accidents or jackknifed trucks blocking the corridor
- Ice accumulation exceeding road treatment capacity

## The 511 System

Nebraska 511 (511.nebraska.gov) is your primary tool for winter travel decisions. Check it before heading west.

### What 511 Shows

| Feature | How to Use It |
|---------|--------------|
| Road conditions | Color-coded map showing normal, wet, icy, snow-covered, and closed roads |
| Closures | Active closure locations with gate positions |
| Cameras | Live camera feeds from key I-80 locations |
| Weather | Current conditions and forecasts by corridor segment |
| Travel advisories | Active warnings and advisories |

### How to Access

- **Web:** 511.nebraska.gov
- **Phone:** Dial 511 from any phone in Nebraska
- **App:** Nebraska 511 app for smartphone alerts
- **Social media:** NDOT posts updates on Twitter/X

:::tip
Set up 511 alerts for your I-80 segments before entering Nebraska. Getting closure notifications in real time prevents you from driving into a closing corridor. This is especially important when cell coverage drops out west of Kearney -- set alerts while you still have signal.

## When to Park vs Push Through

This is the decision that saves lives. The wrong call can strand you in a whiteout with no cell service and no exit for 30 miles.

### Park When

- 511 shows any closure ahead on your route
- Wind advisories exceed 40 mph with precipitation
- Visibility is dropping and you are west of Kearney
- Ground blizzard conditions are reported anywhere on your route
- You are running empty or light (high-profile vehicles are most vulnerable to wind)
- Daylight is ending and conditions are marginal

### Push Through When

- 511 shows clear conditions on your entire remaining route
- Wind is below 30 mph with no precipitation
- Visibility exceeds one mile
- You have fuel for the entire remaining segment plus reserve
- You have cell coverage or a CB radio
- Daylight hours remain for the drive

### Where to Park

If you decide to park, do it at a service city -- not on the shoulder.

| City | I-80 Exit | Services | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Kearney | Exit 272 | Full | Last major city before western exposure |
| North Platte | Exit 177 | Full | Good overnight option |
| Ogallala | Exit 126 | Moderate | Limited parking capacity |
| Sidney | Exit 59 | Moderate | Last option before Wyoming |

Rest areas fill fast during storm events as multiple trucks park simultaneously. Commercial truck stops are the better option.

## Overdimensional Wind Restrictions

Nebraska prohibits overdimensional loads when winds exceed 25 mph. This is a hard restriction that applies statewide.

| Load Type | Wind Threshold | Restriction |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Overdimensional (any oversize dimension) | 25 mph sustained | Prohibited -- must park |
| Overweight only (legal dimensions) | No wind restriction | May continue |

For oversize haulers, this means western Nebraska is often unavailable for travel during the windiest months (November through April). Plan routes and schedules with the understanding that 25 mph winds are common, not exceptional, in Nebraska.

## Studded Tires

Nebraska permits studded tires from November 1 through April 1. Studded tires improve traction on ice but are not a substitute for good judgment about when to park. Chains are permitted but not required by law.

## Survival Kit

For winter I-80 travel through Nebraska, especially west of Kearney:

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| Extra fuel | Fuel stops can be 40+ miles apart in western NE |
| Food and water | Closures can strand you for 24-72+ hours |
| Warm clothing and blankets | If your engine dies, the cab gets cold fast |
| Flashlight with extra batteries | Night comes early in winter; you may need to walk to cab |
| Phone charger (12V) | Keep phone alive for 511 checks when coverage returns |
| CB radio | Works when cell coverage does not |
| Offline maps | Downloaded before Kearney |
| Flares or reflective triangles | Visibility in snow -- do not rely on truck lights alone |

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not pass closure gates.** This is illegal and can result in fines, impoundment, and liability if you cause an accident in a closed section.
- **Do not park on the shoulder during a storm.** You will be hit by a vehicle that cannot see you. Find a truck stop or rest area.
- **Do not assume you can outrun a storm.** Nebraska weather moves fast. A clear sky can become a whiteout in 30 minutes.
- **Do not rely on GPS for timing.** GPS does not account for winter conditions. A 90-minute drive in summer can take 4+ hours in winter or be impossible.
