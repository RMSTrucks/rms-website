## The I-35 Split

The most important thing a trucker new to the Twin Cities needs to understand is the I-35 split. South of the metro, I-35 is a single highway. At the southern edge of the Twin Cities, it divides into two separate interstates:

| Route | Through | Reconnects |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| I-35W | Minneapolis (west side) | North of metro |
| I-35E | St. Paul (east side) | North of metro |

Your routing depends on your destination. Freight bound for Minneapolis proper or western suburbs takes I-35W. Freight bound for St. Paul or eastern suburbs takes I-35E. If you are passing through the metro northbound, either route works, but I-35E typically carries less truck traffic.

## The Beltway: I-494 and I-694

The Twin Cities beltway consists of I-494 (southern half) and I-694 (northern half), forming a complete loop around Minneapolis-St. Paul. Heavy truck traffic, perpetual construction zones, and tight interchanges make the beltway a planning exercise, not a casual drive.

### Key Interchanges

| Interchange | Routes | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| I-494 / I-35W | Southern metro | Major junction, heavy congestion |
| I-494 / I-35E | Southern metro | Mendota Heights area |
| I-694 / I-35W | Northern metro | Brooklyn Center area |
| I-694 / I-35E | Northern metro | Vadnais Heights area |
| I-494 / I-94 | Western metro | Maple Grove area, construction zones |
| I-694 / I-94 | Eastern metro | Woodbury area |
| I-494 / US-169 | Southwestern metro | Bloomington area, near MSP airport |

## Congestion Patterns

| Time | Direction | Severity | Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 6:30-9:00 AM | Inbound on all routes | Heavy | I-35W NB, I-94 EB, I-494 WB worst |
| 3:30-6:30 PM | Outbound on all routes | Heavy | I-35W SB, I-94 WB, I-494 EB worst |
| Midday (10 AM-2 PM) | All | Moderate | Best window for metro deliveries |
| Weekend | All | Light to moderate | Construction zones may still slow traffic |
| Construction season (April-Nov) | Varies | Can be severe | Check MnDOT construction updates |

:::tip
Schedule Twin Cities metro deliveries for the 10 AM to 2 PM window when possible. Rush hour on the beltway with a loaded truck is not productive time -- it is wasted fuel and burned hours.

## MnPASS Express Lanes

MnPASS Express Lanes operate on I-394 and I-35W with dynamic pricing. Trucks are generally excluded from these lanes. Do not enter MnPASS lanes with a commercial vehicle unless signs specifically indicate truck access.

## Truck Parking Near the Metro

| Location | Direction | Approximate Distance from Downtown | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Lakeville area | South on I-35 | 25 mi | Multiple truck stops |
| Rogers area | Northwest on I-94 | 30 mi | Several options |
| Cottage Grove area | Southeast on I-94 | 15 mi | Closer to metro |
| Forest Lake area | North on I-35 | 30 mi | Northern approach |
| Albertville area | Northwest on I-94 | 35 mi | Near I-94/I-494 junction |

Parking inside the beltway for trucks is extremely limited. Plan to stage at peripheral truck stops and make your delivery run during off-peak hours.

## Hazmat Routing

Hazmat routing through the Twin Cities metro follows designated routes. Check with MnDOT for current approved hazmat corridors -- routing restrictions apply particularly around MSP International Airport, downtown Minneapolis, and downtown St. Paul. Do not assume that the most direct route is the approved hazmat route.

## Construction Zones

The Twin Cities metro has perpetual construction from approximately April through November. Major projects can close lanes, shift traffic patterns, and add 30 to 60 minutes to beltway transit times. Check the MnDOT construction updates at 511mn.org before entering the metro, and plan for delays.

## Connection to Frost Law Season

During [spring thaw](/states/trucking-insurance-minnesota/frost-laws/), roads in the Twin Cities metro area may be affected by frost law restrictions on city streets and county roads, even though the interstates remain open. If your delivery point is off the interstate system, verify road restrictions before departing. The combination of metro congestion and frost law routing constraints during March through May makes advance planning essential.
