## No Chain Law, Severe Conditions

Minnesota has no mandatory chain law. This surprises truckers coming from mountain states where chains are required equipment half the year. But the absence of a chain law does not mean Minnesota winters are mild -- it means the hazards are different. The primary threats are extreme cold, black ice, whiteout conditions on open prairie, and Lake Superior weather effects near Duluth.

Studded tires are not allowed in Minnesota. This is year-round with no seasonal exception. Chains are permitted when conditions warrant, and carrying them is prudent even without a mandate.

## Winter Corridor Risk Matrix

| Corridor | Primary Hazard | Severity | Key Concern |
|----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| I-94 (western MN) | Blowing snow, whiteouts | HIGH | Open prairie, no windbreaks, zero visibility possible |
| I-90 (southern MN) | Wind, drifting snow | HIGH | Similar to I-94, flat open terrain |
| I-35 (Albert Lea to Twin Cities) | Black ice, snow | MODERATE | Agricultural area, moderate traffic |
| I-35 (Twin Cities to Duluth) | Grades, lake effect | HIGH | Steep grades, fog, ice, Lake Superior weather |
| MN 61 (North Shore) | Ice, narrow road, lake effect | EXTREME | Treacherous in winter, limited services north of Duluth |
| I-494/I-694 (Twin Cities) | Congestion + ice | MODERATE | Bridge icing, high traffic volume |
| Northern MN (BWCA area) | Extreme cold, limited services | HIGH | Temperatures to -40F, cell gaps |

## I-94 Western Minnesota: Prairie Whiteouts

The I-94 corridor between Moorhead (at the North Dakota border) and St. Cloud crosses some of the flattest, most open terrain in the state. There are no natural windbreaks. When winter storms hit, blowing snow creates whiteout conditions where visibility drops to zero in seconds. This is not reduced visibility -- it is no visibility.

The 2024-2025 winter season saw multiple I-94 closures in western Minnesota due to blowing and drifting snow. Multi-vehicle pileups in whiteout conditions on this corridor are a recurring event, not an anomaly.

### What to Do
- Monitor 511mn.org for road conditions and closures
- If visibility drops, slow down immediately and activate hazard lights
- If visibility reaches zero, pull to the shoulder if you can safely do so
- Do not stop in the travel lanes
- Carry survival gear -- closures can strand drivers for hours
- Cell coverage on I-94 is generally good, but phone batteries drain fast in extreme cold

## I-35 to Duluth: Grades and Lake Effect

The I-35 corridor from the Twin Cities to Duluth climbs from the Mississippi River valley to the Lake Superior shore, with grades that become treacherous when iced. The Duluth area experiences lake effect weather -- sudden fog, snow squalls, and rapid temperature changes driven by Lake Superior.

The Thompson Hill descent into Duluth on I-35 is the most significant grade on the corridor and requires attention in any season. In winter, the combination of grade, ice, and lake-effect fog creates conditions that demand full concentration.

## MN 61 North Shore

MN 61 north of Duluth along the North Shore of Lake Superior is scenic and treacherous in winter. The road is narrow in sections, services are limited north of Two Harbors, and lake effect weather can change conditions within a mile. This is not a recommended winter freight route unless you have specific business on the North Shore.

## Black Ice

Black ice is the invisible hazard on Minnesota highways from late October through April. Bridges and overpasses freeze first. The Twin Cities beltway has hundreds of overpasses, each one a potential black ice zone during temperature transitions near freezing. Southern Minnesota county roads, which are the last to be treated, carry higher black ice risk than interstates.

## Temperature Extremes

| Condition | Implication |
|-----------|------------|
| -20F to -40F (wind chill) | Exposed skin frostbite in minutes, diesel gelling risk |
| -10F to -20F (air temp) | Common in January-February across state |
| 0F to 32F (transition zone) | Black ice formation, freeze-thaw cycling |

Diesel fuel gelling is a real operational concern below -20F. Use winter-blend fuel and carry anti-gel treatment. Block heaters and auxiliary heaters are not luxuries in Minnesota -- they are operational requirements.

## Road Closure Procedures

MnDOT closes roads when conditions make travel unsafe. Check 511mn.org for current closures. When a road closure is posted:
- En-route vehicles may proceed to the nearest safe stopping point
- New trips on closed roads are not permitted
- MnDOT and State Patrol enforce closures at access points
- Closures can last from hours to days depending on storm severity

## Winter Survival Equipment

Minnesota does not require specific survival equipment by law, but the following should be in every cab from November through March:

- Blankets or sleeping bag rated to -30F
- Food and water for 48 hours
- Flashlight with extra batteries
- Portable phone charger (cold drains batteries fast)
- Ice scraper and snow brush
- Extra fuel treatment (anti-gel)
- Warm clothing layers, insulated boots, gloves rated to -20F

## Insurance and Winter Risk

Winter driving in Minnesota increases claim severity. Icy roads, reduced visibility, and long response times in rural areas all contribute to higher-cost incidents. Minnesota's no-fault insurance structure adds complexity to winter accident claims. [Minnesota trucking insurance](/states/trucking-insurance-minnesota/) should account for the full winter risk profile -- $1,000,000 CSL provides meaningful protection against the kind of multi-vehicle incidents that winter conditions produce on I-94 and I-35.
