## The Crisis by the Numbers

Indiana has one of the worst truck parking shortages in the country. The math is stark:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ratio of parking spots to semis | 1 to 11 |
| Common illegal parking locations | Interstate ramps |
| INDOT investment committed | $600 million |
| New spaces planned | 1,200+ |
| Capacity increase | Doubling state-owned capacity |
| Investment timeline | 10-year plan |

Drivers routinely park on interstate ramps, shoulders, and in unauthorized areas because legal parking fills up hours before the mandatory rest period hits. This creates safety hazards and expensive tickets for drivers who have no other option.

## INDOT $600M Improvement Plan

INDOT has committed $600 million over 10 years to address the parking crisis. The plan includes:
- Adding 1,200+ new truck parking spaces across the state
- Doubling state-owned truck parking capacity
- TPIMS (Truck Parking Information Management System) technology for real-time availability
- New rest area construction and expansion of existing facilities

## Recently Completed Facilities

### I-65 Lebanon (150 Spaces)

Located north of Indianapolis in the Lebanon/Whitestown distribution center corridor. This facility directly serves the fastest-growing freight zone in the state and provides critical parking for drivers heading to and from the distribution centers along I-65.

### I-70 Clear Creek Welcome Center (128 Spaces)

Located eastbound on I-70, this expanded welcome center provides truck parking for carriers running the east-west corridor through Indianapolis. The 128 truck spaces make it one of the largest state-owned truck parking facilities in Indiana.

## Where to Find Parking by Corridor

### I-65 Corridor
- Lebanon rest area (150 spaces, north of Indianapolis)
- Seymour area rest areas (south of Indianapolis)
- Lowell area (between Chicago and Indianapolis)

### I-70 Corridor
- Clear Creek Welcome Center (128 spaces, eastbound)
- Richmond area rest areas (near Ohio border)
- Terre Haute area rest areas (near Illinois border)

### I-80/90 Toll Road
- Service plazas along the toll road (limited truck parking)
- Note: Toll road parking is managed by ITRCC, not INDOT

### I-69 Corridor
- Limited state-owned parking; private facilities near Fort Wayne

## TPIMS Real-Time Availability

INDOT is deploying Truck Parking Information Management System (TPIMS) technology that provides real-time parking availability data. When fully deployed, drivers will be able to check available spaces at Indiana rest areas and parking facilities via:
- Electronic highway signs showing parking availability at upcoming rest areas
- Mobile apps and fleet management integrations
- INDOT website

:::tip
Plan your parking stop early. In Indiana, if you wait until your HOS clock runs out to look for parking, you will likely end up on a ramp. Check TPIMS data and target a facility 30-60 minutes before your mandatory rest.
