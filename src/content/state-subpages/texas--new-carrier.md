## Why Texas Leads in New Trucking Companies

Texas has more new trucking company formations than any other state. The combination of the largest freight market, no state income tax, non-mandatory workers compensation, and proximity to the Mexican border creates ideal startup conditions. The flip side: competition is fierce, and cutting corners on insurance or compliance will end your authority before you build momentum.

## Step 1: Form Your Business Entity

Register with the Texas Secretary of State. Most carriers choose an LLC for liability protection. Filing fee: 300 dollars. Timeline: 1-3 business days online. Get your EIN from the IRS -- free, immediate online.

## Step 2: Get Your USDOT Number

Every commercial motor vehicle operating interstate or carrying hazmat must have a USDOT number. Apply through the FMCSA portal. Cost: Free. Timeline: Immediate online.

## Step 3: Apply for Operating Authority (MC Number)

For-hire carriers need operating authority. File Form OP-1 with FMCSA. Cost: 300 dollars. Timeline: 20-25 business days.

## Step 4: Get Insurance

Insurance must be in place before FMCSA activates your authority.

| Coverage | Minimum | RMS Recommendation |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Auto Liability | 750,000 (federal interstate) | 1,000,000 CSL |
| Cargo | Not federally required | 100,000 (broker standard) |
| Physical Damage | Not required | Required if financed |
| Workers Comp | Not required in Texas | Recommended |

### Insurance Filings

- **BMC-91 or BMC-91X:** Proof of financial responsibility filed with FMCSA
- **BOC-3:** Designation of process agents (about 30-50 dollars)
- **Form E:** Texas intrastate insurance filing through eLINC

:::tip
New authority carriers pay higher premiums for the first 2 years. A clean CSA record and zero claims will bring rates down significantly by year 3. RMS specializes in new authority placements -- call (208) 800-0640.

## Step 5: Texas State Registration (Intrastate)

Register with TxDMV through the eLINC portal for CMVs over 26,000 lbs GVWR.

| Type | Duration | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| 7-Day | 7 days | Temporary operations |
| 90-Day | 90 days | Short-term contracts |
| 1-Year | 12 months | Standard operations |
| 2-Year | 24 months | Established carriers, best value |

## Step 6: IFTA Registration

Free license and decals through the Texas Comptroller. Required if entering Texas 5 or more times per calendar year. Quarterly returns.

## Step 7: IRP Registration

International Registration Plan through TxDMV. Cost based on percentage of miles driven in each state.

## Step 8: UCR Registration

| Fleet Size | 2026 Fee |
|-----------|----------|
| 0-2 vehicles | 176 |
| 3-5 vehicles | 525 |
| 6-20 vehicles | 1,048 |

2026 UCR enforcement began January 1, 2026.

## Step 9: Drug and Alcohol Testing

Pre-employment test required before any driver operates a CMV. Random testing: 50 percent of drivers annually. Consortium enrollment required for owner-operators. Cost: 100-200 per year per driver.
