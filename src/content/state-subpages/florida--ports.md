## Four Ports, Four Operating Environments

Florida has four major commercial ports, each with different access requirements, gate procedures, and insurance considerations. Port drayage in Florida is year-round work -- no winter slowdowns. Every port requires a TWIC (Transportation Worker Identification Credential) card. Apply early -- processing takes 8-12 weeks.

## JAXPORT (Jacksonville)

Florida largest container port by tonnage and the nation leading vehicle import hub.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| TWIC Card | Required for all drivers |
| JAXPORT Business Purpose Credential | Free, required in addition to TWIC |
| Port Hours | 24/7 port operations, terminal-specific gate hours |
| Insurance | 1,000,000 liability (practical minimum) |

Access Blount Island Terminal via I-295 to Heckscher Drive. Avoid GPS directions for passenger vehicles -- they may route through residential areas with bridge restrictions.

:::tip
JAXPORT offers a chassis pool for intermodal carriers. Confirm chassis availability before arriving -- shortages during peak season (October-December) create staging delays.

## PortMiami

Cruise capital of the world and growing containerized cargo hub. The Port Tunnel provides direct access to I-395 and I-95.

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| TWIC Card | Required |

## Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale)

Over 1 million TEUs annually. Major petroleum import point for South Florida. Direct access from I-595.

## Insurance for Port Drayage

| Coverage | Why Port Drayage Needs It |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Auto Liability (1M)** | Dense port traffic, pedestrian areas, tight turns |
| **Cargo Coverage** | High-value containerized freight, theft exposure |
| **Non-Trucking Liability** | Waiting time between loads at port facilities |
| **Physical Damage** | Equipment damage from port infrastructure |

## TWIC Card Process

| Step | Details | Timeline |
|------|---------|----------|
| Apply online | TSA TWIC Portal | Day 1 |
| Biometrics appointment | Nearest enrollment center | 1-2 weeks |
| Background check | Federal process | 4-8 weeks |
| Card issuance | Pick up at enrollment center | 1-2 weeks |
| **Total** | | **8-12 weeks** |

:::tip
Apply for your TWIC card at least 3 months before you plan to start port work. Expedited processing is not available. There is no shortcut.
