## How the Frozen Road Program Works

Wisconsin's frozen road program is unique in the nation. When the ground freezes to a depth of 18 inches or more, WisDOT or local authorities issue a frozen road declaration that allows qualifying vehicles to haul significantly more weight without a permit.

### Program Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Ground freeze depth required | 18 inches or more |
| Maximum weight (5+ axle vehicles) | 98,000 lbs |
| Standard GVW limit | 80,000 lbs |
| Weight increase | 22.5 percent above standard |
| Permit required | No |
| Typical active period | Mid-December through late February/early March |

### Qualifying Commodities

- **Raw forest products:** Logs, pulpwood, and other unprocessed wood products
- **Road salt and abrasives:** Municipal and contractor salt/sand haulers

Only these commodity categories qualify. Processed forest products, general freight, and other cargo types are not eligible regardless of ground conditions.

## Revenue Impact

The 22.5 percent weight increase translates directly to revenue per load for qualifying haulers:

| Scenario | Weight | Revenue Impact |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Standard load | 80,000 lbs | Baseline |
| Frozen road load | 98,000 lbs | ~22.5 percent more product per trip |

For forest product haulers running multiple loads per day during the frozen road period, the additional tonnage per trip compounds significantly over the season. Savvy operators schedule their heaviest hauling to coincide with frozen road declarations.

## Declaration Process

Frozen road declarations are issued by:
- **WisDOT** for state highways
- **Local authorities** for county and municipal roads

Declarations are based on measured ground freeze depth, not calendar dates. A warm spell can end the declaration early, and a delayed freeze can push the start date later than expected. Monitor WisDOT announcements for current status.

## Spring Thaw Restrictions

The flip side of the frozen road advantage is the spring thaw penalty. As frozen ground thaws, roads become vulnerable to damage from heavy loads.

### Class 2 Road Restrictions

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Typical period | Early March through mid-May |
| Affected roads | Class 2 roads (local and county) |
| Weight limit reduction | Varies by road and authority |
| Interstate impact | Generally not affected |

Spring thaw restrictions primarily affect the same local roads that benefit from the frozen road program. The routes that carry 98,000 lbs in January may be restricted to well below 80,000 lbs in April.

## Planning Your Season

- **December-February:** Maximize loads during frozen road declarations. Monitor WisDOT for declaration dates.
- **March-May:** Reduce loads on Class 2 roads. Plan routes using interstates and Class 1 highways where possible.
- **Check daily:** Ground conditions change. A frozen road declaration can be rescinded if temperatures rise above freezing for an extended period.

:::tip
The frozen road program is a competitive advantage for Wisconsin-based forest product haulers. Time your heaviest cuts and longest hauls to the frozen road window. The 18,000 lbs of extra capacity per trip adds up to tens of thousands of dollars over the season.
