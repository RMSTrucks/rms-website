## Dundalk Marine Terminal

Dundalk is the largest terminal at 570 acres with 13 berths and 4 container cranes. Access from I-95 is via I-695 to the Broening Highway exit.

**Exit restriction:** When leaving Dundalk, you may NOT turn left toward Keith Avenue or use I-95 Exit 56. Follow the designated truck exit route to return to I-695.

## Seagirt Marine Terminal

Seagirt handles the majority of container traffic at the Port of Baltimore. An RFID tag is required for gate entry -- register through eModal (emodal.com) before your first visit. Without RFID, you will be turned away at the gate.

**Exit restriction:** When leaving Seagirt, you may NOT turn right toward Dunhill Road or Dundalk Avenue. Follow the designated exit to Broening Highway.

## Fairfield and Masonville Terminals

Both terminals are accessed via I-895 and the Childs Street ramps. Trucks with valid Maryland E-ZPass accounts receive a toll discount of $2 per axle when accessing these terminals -- a meaningful savings for frequent port truckers.

## Port Access Toll Discount

Vehicles accessing marine terminals with a valid Maryland E-ZPass account pay reduced toll rates at the Harbor Tunnel and connecting facilities. This discount applies automatically when your E-ZPass is registered with a port access designation through DriveEzMD.com.

:::tip
Seagirt RFID registration through eModal is mandatory -- not optional. Register online before your first trip to avoid being turned away at the gate. Allow 24-48 hours for RFID activation after registration.
