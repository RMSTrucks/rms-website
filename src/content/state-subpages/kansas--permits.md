## K-TRIPS: Kansas Online Permit System

Kansas handles all oversize/overweight permits through K-TRIPS (Kansas Truck Routing and Intelligent Permitting System). The system is online-only -- there are no walk-in offices for permit applications.

**KDOT Central Permit Office:** 785-368-6501

## Permit Types

| Permit Type | Duration | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Single-trip (24-hour) | 24 hours from issue | Quick turnaround loads |
| Single-trip (72-hour) | 72 hours from issue | Loads needing more flexibility |
| Annual oversize | 12 months | Repeated oversize loads on regular routes |
| Annual overweight | 12 months | Repeated overweight loads on regular routes |

Single-trip permits are the most common. The 72-hour option gives extra flexibility if you cannot guarantee your exact travel time.

## Kansas Dimensional Limits

Kansas has some generous standard limits compared to other states:

| Dimension | Kansas Limit | National Standard | Kansas Advantage |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Height | 14 ft | 13.5-13.6 ft | +4-6 inches |
| Height (cylindrical hay bales) | 14.5 ft | N/A | Ag economy exception |
| Width | 8.5 ft | 8.5 ft | Standard |
| Trailer length | 59 ft 6 in | 53 ft | +6.5 feet |
| GVW (interstate) | 80,000 lb | 80,000 lb | Standard |

The 14-foot height limit and 59-foot 6-inch trailer length are notably more generous than most states. This means loads that require oversize permits elsewhere may travel at legal dimensions in Kansas.

## Operating Hour Restrictions

| Load Type | Time Restriction |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Oversize (any dimension beyond legal) | Daylight only: half hour before sunrise to half hour after sunset |
| Overweight only (legal dimensions) | No time restriction -- 24-hour travel permitted |
| Combination oversize + overweight | Daylight only |

The distinction matters: if your load is over 80,000 lb but within all dimensional limits, you can travel at night. If it exceeds any dimensional limit, you are restricted to daylight hours.

## Weight Limits

| Axle Configuration | Kansas Limit |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lb |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lb |
| Tridem axle | 48,000 lb |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000 lb |

## The PrePass/Oversize Exception

This catches haulers off guard: **trucks with oversize or overweight loads must STILL enter open weigh stations even with a green PrePass signal.** PrePass bypass authorization does not apply to permitted loads.

The one exception: LCV (Longer Combination Vehicle) carriers with Kansas Industrial Authority (KIA) permits at the South Haven station on the Turnpike.

If you have a permitted load and see a green PrePass light, you must still pull in. Driving past an open station with an oversize/overweight permit is a violation.

## How to Get a Permit

### Single-Trip Through K-TRIPS

1. Access K-TRIPS through the KDOT website
2. Enter vehicle and load specifications (dimensions, weight, axle configuration)
3. Enter origin and destination -- the system generates an approved route
4. Pay online (credit card accepted)
5. Print the permit -- it must be in the cab during transport
6. Follow the approved route exactly -- deviation is a violation

### Route Restrictions

K-TRIPS generates specific routes for each permit. The system accounts for:

- Bridge weight limits and clearances along the route
- Construction zones that may block oversize passage
- Road classifications that restrict certain weights
- Time-of-day restrictions for oversize loads

**Route deviation is a serious violation.** If your approved route is blocked (construction, accident), contact KDOT Central Permit Office at 785-368-6501 for a route amendment before deviating.

## Wind Restrictions for Oversize

Kansas does not have a formal statewide wind restriction for oversize loads like Nebraska (which prohibits overdimensional loads when winds exceed 25 mph). However, KDOT may restrict or suspend oversize permits during severe weather events, and practical safety demands that high-profile oversize loads not travel in western Kansas during high wind events.

If you are hauling oversize through western Kansas and wind advisories are active, the smart move is to park and wait regardless of what the permit allows. A flipped load costs far more than a delay.

## Hazmat CDL Enforcement

Kansas is strict on hazmat CDL violations:

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|------------|
| First major hazmat CDL violation | 3-year CDL cancellation |
| Second offense or controlled substance | Lifetime CDL revocation |

## County Road Permits

Some Kansas counties may have additional permit requirements for loads traveling on county roads. If your K-TRIPS route includes county roads, check with the county for any local permit requirements. County roads may also have seasonal weight postings, particularly during spring thaw.
