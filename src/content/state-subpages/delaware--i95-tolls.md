## The 23-Mile Corridor

Delaware has exactly 23 miles of I-95. The Delaware Turnpike carries I-95 from the Maryland border to the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which connects to the NJ Turnpike. There is no practical bypass for north-south through-traffic -- every I-95 truck crosses Delaware.

## Delaware Turnpike Tolls (2026)

The Delaware Turnpike toll plaza sits at approximately mile marker 1, near the Maryland border.

| Axles | E-ZPass | Toll By Plate |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | $4.00 | $6.00 |
| 3 | $6.00 | $10.00 |
| 4 | $6.00 | $10.00 |
| 5 | $32.50 | $40.00 |
| 6+ | $39.00 | $48.00 |
| OS/OW permitted vehicle | $12.00 flat | $12.00 flat |

## Delaware Memorial Bridge Tolls

The Delaware Memorial Bridge is operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA). The toll is collected in the NJ-to-DE direction only (westbound). If you are traveling southbound on I-95 from NJ into DE, you pay at the bridge. Northbound traffic (DE to NJ) is toll-free.

| Axles | E-ZPass | Cash |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | $5.00 | $5.00 |
| 3 | $12.50 | $15.00 |
| 4 | $20.00 | $25.00 |
| 5 | $35.00 | $40.00 |
| 6+ | $42.00 | $48.00 |

## Total Transit Cost

A 5-axle truck crossing Delaware on I-95 in the NJ-to-south direction:

| Component | E-ZPass | Without E-ZPass |
|---|---|---|
| Delaware Memorial Bridge | $35.00 | $40.00 (cash) |
| Delaware Turnpike | $32.50 | $40.00 (TBP) |
| **Total** | **$67.50** | **$80.00** |

Carriers running this corridor daily face $33,750+ per year in Delaware tolls alone (250 working days x $67.50 x 2 directions).

## I-495 Wilmington Bypass

I-495 provides a 12-mile bypass around Wilmington, connecting I-95 south of the city to I-95 north. Use I-495 to:
- Avoid Wilmington city traffic
- Access the Port of Wilmington (Exit 2)
- Connect to local routes without entering the I-95 mainline through the city

## Service Areas

Delaware has limited service areas on I-95. The Delaware House Travel Plaza (mile marker 5.5 area) provides fuel and food but limited truck parking. Most carriers park in Maryland (south) or New Jersey (north) for overnight stops.

## Neighboring Toll Comparison

| Corridor Segment | 5-Axle E-ZPass Toll |
|---|---|
| Delaware Turnpike | $32.50 |
| Delaware Memorial Bridge | $35.00 |
| NJ Turnpike (full length) | ~$55-60 |
| MD JFK Highway (I-95 north) | $63 (out-of-state EZP) |
| PA Turnpike (full length) | $100+ |

:::tip
Delaware tolls are unavoidable on I-95 -- there is no bypass. Budget $67.50 per crossing (E-ZPass) into every I-95 corridor run between NJ and Maryland. The only way to reduce this cost is to ensure you are using E-ZPass rather than Toll By Plate.
