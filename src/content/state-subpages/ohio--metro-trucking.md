## Cleveland Metro

### Hazmat Restrictions

Cleveland has some of the strictest municipal hazmat routing rules in Ohio:
- **Through-traffic hazmat:** Prohibited unless the load originates or delivers within Cleveland or within 1 mile of city limits
- **Downtown hazmat:** Prohibited 7 AM to 6 PM daily
- These restrictions apply to placarded hazmat loads only

Hazmat carriers transiting northern Ohio should use the Turnpike (I-80/76) to bypass Cleveland rather than routing through the city on I-90 or I-77.

### Key Interchanges

- **I-480/I-77:** Active construction and frequent congestion. Avoid during rush hours.
- **I-90/I-71 merge:** Short weave section with frequent incidents.
- **I-77 through Cuyahoga Valley:** Winding terrain, watch speed in winter conditions.

### Lake-Effect Snow

Lake Erie produces intense lake-effect snow bands across Ashtabula, Lake, and Cuyahoga counties. I-90 east of Cleveland is the most affected interstate. Whiteout conditions can materialize in minutes with little warning. Check [OHGO](https://www.ohgo.com) cameras before committing to I-90 in winter.

<!-- DYNAMIC:type=weather state=OH -->
**Cleveland Weather:** Lake-effect snow can create whiteout conditions along I-90. Check [OHGO.com](https://www.ohgo.com) for live camera feeds. *(Live OHGO weather data coming soon.)*

## Columbus Metro

### Hazmat Routing

- **Through-traffic hazmat:** Must use the I-270 outerbelt. Hazmat is prohibited inside I-270 without a Columbus origin or destination.
- This affects all placarded loads transiting central Ohio.
- I-270 provides a full 360-degree bypass around the metro.

### Key Interchanges

- **I-70/I-71 downtown interchange:** Complex, accident-prone, and frequently congested. If you can use I-270 to bypass downtown, do it.
- **I-71/I-270 north:** Major merge point with distribution center traffic.
- **I-70/I-270 west:** Heavy truck traffic from warehouse clusters.

### Congestion Patterns

- Morning rush: 7-9 AM, worst on I-71 NB and I-70 EB into downtown
- Evening rush: 4-6:30 PM, worst on I-71 SB and I-70 WB
- I-270 stays more consistent but still backs up at major interchanges during peaks

## Cincinnati Metro

### Key Interchanges

- **I-71/I-75 merge (Brent Spence Bridge corridor):** One of the most congested freight corridors in the Midwest. The bridge carries I-71 and I-75 traffic across the Ohio River into Kentucky on a structurally deficient span.
- **I-275 outerbelt:** Use this to bypass the downtown core when possible.
- **I-75 through Dayton at I-70:** Rush hour backups are common at this interchange.

### Ohio River Crossings

- Brent Spence Bridge (I-71/I-75): Congested, replacement project in planning
- I-275 bridges: Less congested alternatives east and west of downtown

## Lorain Hazmat Restrictions

The City of Lorain prohibits hazmat through-traffic on multiple state routes within city limits. Hazmat carriers should check routing through Lorain County carefully and use I-90 or the Turnpike as alternatives.

## Metro Parking Tips

- Columbus: Distribution center areas around I-270 have private truck parking options. Rest areas on I-70 and I-71 fill up by early evening.
- Cleveland: Limited truck parking in the metro core. Plan stops south of the city on I-77 or east on the Turnpike.
- Cincinnati: I-75 rest areas south of Dayton are the best options. The $150M parking expansion will add significant capacity by end of 2027.
