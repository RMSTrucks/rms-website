## Five Toll Facilities

Maryland operates 5 separate toll facilities, each with its own rate structure. Out-of-state E-ZPass holders pay MORE than Maryland E-ZPass holders at every facility.

### Complete 5-Axle Toll Rate Comparison

| Facility | Interstate | Pay-By-Plate | Out-of-State E-ZPass | MD E-ZPass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| JFK Memorial Highway | I-95 (north of Baltimore) | $48 | $63 | Lower |
| Fort McHenry/Harbor Tunnels | I-95/I-895 | $24 | $36 | Lower |
| Bay Bridge | US 50/301 | $24 | $36 | Lower |
| Nice/Middleton Bridge | US 301 | $36 | $51 | Lower |
| I-95 Express Toll Lanes | I-95 (Baltimore area) | Variable | $2.73-$22.61 | Same |

## JFK Memorial Highway (I-95 North)

The JFK Memorial Highway toll plaza sits on I-95 between Baltimore and the Delaware border. This is the most expensive single toll point in Maryland for trucks. At $63 for a 5-axle truck with out-of-state E-ZPass, a single northbound/southbound transit costs $63.

## Baltimore Tunnels

Both the Fort McHenry Tunnel (I-95) and Harbor Tunnel (I-895) charge the same toll rate. The toll applies in both directions.

## Bay Bridge (US 50/301)

The Chesapeake Bay Bridge connects the Western Shore to the Eastern Shore. The toll applies eastbound only. Five-axle trucks pay $24 Pay-By-Plate or $36 out-of-state E-ZPass.

## Nice/Middleton Bridge (US 301)

The Governor Harry W. Nice/Thomas "Mac" Middleton Memorial Bridge crosses the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia. The toll applies northbound (entering Maryland) only.

## I-95 Express Toll Lanes

The Express Toll Lanes on I-95 in the Baltimore area use dynamic pricing that varies by time of day and congestion level. Rates for 5-axle trucks range from $2.73 (overnight) to $22.61 (peak congestion). All vehicles must have E-ZPass to use ETLs.

## Video Toll Surcharge

If you pass through a toll facility without E-ZPass, Maryland uses video tolling (Pay-By-Plate). The surcharge is 1.5 times the base toll rate, with a minimum surcharge of $1 and maximum of $15 above the base toll.

## Why You Need a Maryland E-ZPass

If you run Maryland regularly, a Maryland E-ZPass account saves substantial money compared to out-of-state transponders. Maryland E-ZPass holders pay lower rates at all 5 toll facilities. Open an account at DriveEzMD.com.

**Annual savings example:** A carrier crossing the JFK Highway and a tunnel twice weekly saves $3,000-$5,000 per year with a MD E-ZPass account compared to out-of-state E-ZPass rates.

:::tip
A single I-95 transit through Baltimore touching both the JFK Highway and a tunnel can cost $70+ with an out-of-state E-ZPass. A Maryland E-ZPass account is one of the fastest ways to reduce operating costs on this corridor.
