## South Carolina Weigh Station Master Table

South Carolina operates 13 weigh stations across its major interstates. The state uses a color-coded sign system: GREEN means the station is open, RED means closed. Simple and trucker-friendly.

| Interstate | Location | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| I-95 | Hardeeville | MM 4 | NB/SB | Near GA border |
| I-95 | Canadys | MM 74 | NB/SB | -- |
| I-26 | Pomeria | MM 81 | EB/WB | -- |
| I-26 | Chapin | MM 93.5 | EB/WB | Near Columbia |
| I-26 | Harleyville | MM 173-174 | EB/WB | East of I-95 |
| I-77 | Rock Hill | MM 85-89 | NB/SB | Near NC border |
| I-85 | Fair Play | MM 9 | NB/SB | Near GA border |
| I-20 | Steedman | MM 35 | EB/WB | -- |
| I-20 | Lexington | MM 53.5 | EB/WB | Near Columbia |

PrePass and Drivewyze are both active at South Carolina stations. The state Size & Transport Police (STP) handles all CMV enforcement across all 46 counties, including a specialized HAZMAT/Level VI Team trained for Savannah River Site nuclear material transport.

## Speed Limits

South Carolina has no differential truck speed limit. Trucks follow the same posted speeds as cars:

| Setting | Posted Speed |
|---------|-------------|
| Rural interstate | 70 mph |
| Urban interstate | 60 mph |
| I-26 Charleston approach | 55-60 mph |

## I-95: Georgia to North Carolina (199 Miles)

Flat, straight, and largely rural. I-95 through South Carolina is one of the easier segments of the entire Eastern Seaboard, but the monotony creates genuine fatigue risk on long runs.

**Hardeeville (MM 4):** Weigh stations just north of the [Georgia border](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/corridors/). First checkpoint after crossing the Savannah River.

**Canadys (MM 74):** Weigh stations in the Lowcountry. Light traffic between stations makes this a quick segment.

**Florence (MM 157-170):** The I-95/I-20 junction creates a natural distribution hub. Good truck stop infrastructure and parking availability. Florence is where east-west and north-south freight streams cross.

**Dillon (MM 190-198):** Approaching the [North Carolina border](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/corridors/). Speed enforcement increases near the state line.

## I-26: Charleston to Spartanburg (220 Miles)

I-26 is the freight spine of South Carolina, connecting the Port of Charleston to the inland Southeast. Heavy drayage traffic runs this corridor daily, especially between the port and the I-26/I-85 junction at Spartanburg.

**Charleston Port Area (MM 210-220):** Drayage traffic is heaviest during [terminal gate hours](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/charleston-port/). Expect congestion on the final approach to port terminals during morning openings.

**Harleyville (MM 173-174):** Weigh stations east of the I-95 crossing. This checkpoint catches port-bound traffic.

**Columbia (MM 100-115):** The state capital generates moderate congestion, particularly at the I-26/I-126/I-20 interchange complex.

**Spartanburg (MM 15-22):** The I-26/I-85 junction is where port freight meets [Upstate industrial traffic](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/upstate/). This interchange handles significant volume.

## I-85: Georgia to North Carolina (106 Miles)

South Carolina's industrial heartland. The I-85 corridor through the Upstate is dense with automotive manufacturing, tire plants, and distribution operations.

**Fair Play (MM 9):** Weigh station near the Georgia border. Northbound traffic from [Atlanta](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/atlanta-freight/) enters here.

**Greenville/Spartanburg (MM 50-70):** The core of the [Upstate industrial corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/upstate/). BMW's Greer plant, Michelin NA headquarters, and a dense network of automotive suppliers generate heavy truck traffic. The Southern Connector (I-185) is the only toll road in South Carolina, running through the Greenville area.

**Gaffney to NC border (MM 90-106):** Approaching [Charlotte](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/charlotte-hub/) via I-85. Traffic density increases approaching the state line.

## I-77: Columbia to Charlotte (91 Miles)

A shorter corridor connecting South Carolina's capital to Charlotte, North Carolina.

**Rock Hill (MM 85-89):** Weigh stations near the NC border. Rock Hill has seen significant warehousing growth driven by Charlotte metro expansion southward.

## I-20: Augusta to Florence (141 Miles)

The east-west artery through central South Carolina.

**Aiken County:** Proximity to the Savannah River Site means nuclear material transport occurs on connecting routes. SC's specialized HAZMAT/Level VI Team operates in this area. Follow posted routing for restricted materials.

**Steedman (MM 35) and Lexington (MM 53.5):** Weigh stations bracketing the Columbia metro area.

**Florence (MM 141):** Eastern terminus at the I-95 junction. Good staging area for north-south transitions.

## Toll Roads

South Carolina is nearly toll-free. The only toll facility is the Southern Connector (I-185) in Greenville:

| Vehicle Class | Palmetto Pass Rate | Cash Rate |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 2-axle | $1.80 | $2.00 |
| 3-axle | $3.60 | $4.00 |
| 4-axle | $5.40 | $6.00 |
| 5+ axle | $7.20 | $8.00 |

Palmetto Pass is electronic tolling. All major interstates in South Carolina are free.

## Connecting Corridors

I-95 continues south into [Georgia](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/corridors/) and north into [North Carolina](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/corridors/). I-85 connects to [Atlanta](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/atlanta-freight/) southbound and [Charlotte](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/charlotte-hub/) northbound. I-26 is the primary route from the [Port of Charleston](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/charleston-port/) to the [Upstate industrial corridor](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/upstate/).
