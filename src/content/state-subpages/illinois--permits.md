## ITAP Online Permit System

Illinois processes oversize/overweight (OSOW) permits through the ITAP (Illinois Transportation Automated Permits) online portal. Permits are vehicle-specific and valid for 72 hours from the issue time.

### Permit Types

| Permit Type | Duration | Movement Rules |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| Overweight (legal dimensions) | 72 hours | 24/7 movement allowed |
| Oversize | 72 hours | No Sunday movement, no movement on 6 holidays |
| Superload | Case-by-case | Routing and escort requirements vary |

## Scale Tolerances

Illinois applies the following scale tolerances before a violation is issued:

| Axle Configuration | Tolerance |
|-------------------|----------|
| Single axle | +2,000 lbs |
| Tandem axle | +3,000 lbs |
| Gross vehicle weight | +5,000 lbs |

These tolerances mean that a truck at 82,000 lbs on the scale (with an 80,000 lb GVW limit) would not trigger a violation. However, do not plan loads around tolerances -- they exist to account for scale calibration, not to extend your legal limits.

## Dual Permit System: IDOT + Tollway

This is the critical detail that catches haulers off guard: **the Illinois Tollway requires a SEPARATE overweight/overdimension permit from the IDOT/ITAP permit.** An IDOT permit does not authorize travel on Tollway roads, and a Tollway permit does not cover IDOT routes. If your route crosses both systems, you need both permits.

### Tollway Permit Process

- Contact the Illinois Tollway directly for overweight/overdimension permits
- Separate application, separate fees, separate routing review
- Tollway may have different routing restrictions than IDOT
- Bridge clearance and weight reviews are Tollway-specific

## Movement Restrictions

### Oversize Loads
- **No Sunday movement** (all day)
- **No movement on 6 holidays:** New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas
- Night movement may require additional lighting and escort vehicles

### Overweight Loads (Legal Dimensions)
- 24/7 movement is permitted -- no day-of-week or holiday restrictions
- This only applies if your load is overweight but does not exceed legal dimensions

## Spring Thaw (Seasonal Posting)

From approximately January 15 through April 15, county authorities can restrict local and county roads to 5 tons per axle for up to 90 days. These postings:
- Apply primarily to local/county roads, not interstates
- Update on Monday and Thursday mornings
- Can change with little notice as weather conditions shift
- Affect the last-mile routing for many oversize/overweight deliveries

Check with the relevant county highway department before routing OSOW loads on non-interstate roads during this period.

## What You Need for Your Application

- Vehicle identification and registration
- Load dimensions (length, width, height, overhang)
- Weight per axle and gross weight
- Axle configuration and spacing
- Origin and destination addresses
- Proposed route
- Proof of insurance ($1M minimum recommended)
- Any special requirements (pilot cars, escorts, law enforcement)
