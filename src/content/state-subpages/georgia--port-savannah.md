## Garden City Terminal: The Numbers

The Port of Savannah handles over 5.8 million TEUs annually through the largest single-terminal container facility in North America. Garden City Terminal sits on 1,200 acres along the Savannah River, and every container that moves through it arrives or departs by truck or rail. For drayage operators, understanding gate procedures is not optional -- it is the difference between a profitable day and a wasted one.

### Gate Hours and Last Ticket Times

| Terminal | Gate Hours | Last Ticket (Reefer) | Last Ticket (Dry Pickup) | Last Ticket (Dry Drop) |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Garden City (Mon-Fri) | 6:00 AM - 6:00 PM | 4:15 PM | 4:30 PM | 5:00 PM |
| Garden City (Saturday) | 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM (Gate 4 only) | 3:15 PM | 3:30 PM | 4:00 PM |
| Garden City (Sunday) | Closed | -- | -- | -- |

Those last ticket times are hard deadlines. If you arrive at 4:16 PM for a reefer pickup on a weekday, you are done. Plan your route to arrive at least 45 minutes before last ticket.

### Required Credentials

| Credential | Who Needs It | How to Get It |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| TWIC Card | Drivers making 5+ visits in 365 days | Apply at TSA enrollment center |
| GPA Badge | All drivers accessing terminal | Register with Georgia Ports Authority |

Download the GPA mobile app before your first run. It shows real-time gate wait times, container availability, and terminal alerts. Drivers who check the app before heading to the terminal save an average of 30-45 minutes per trip by timing their arrival.

## Truck Routes to Garden City Terminal

The standard approach is I-95 to I-16 West, then exit to GA-21 (Savannah Airport Industrial Boulevard) toward Garden City. This route keeps you on interstates and designated truck routes the entire way.

### From I-95 Northbound (Florida)
Take I-95 North to I-16 West at Exit 99. Follow I-16 West to GA-21 (Exit 164). Turn right on GA-21 toward Garden City Terminal.

### From I-95 Southbound (South Carolina)
Take I-95 South to I-16 West at Exit 99. Same routing from there.

### From Atlanta via I-16
I-16 East runs 167 miles from Macon to Savannah. This is one of the most truck-dense highways in Georgia. Limited services between Macon and Savannah -- fuel up before the run. Exit at GA-21.

## Gates 3, 4, and 8: Scale Locations

Gates 3, 4, and 8 have truck scales. Your container will be weighed on entry and exit. Overweight containers get held, and the port will not release them until the weight issue is resolved. Know your load weights before arrival.

## Wait Time Strategies

Peak congestion at Garden City Terminal runs from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM on weekdays. The lunch window between 11:30 AM and 1:00 PM typically has shorter waits. Late afternoon arrivals after 3:00 PM risk hitting last ticket cutoffs but often have the shortest queue times.

Saturday operations through Gate 4 only tend to have significantly shorter waits but limited hours. For carriers with flexible scheduling, Saturday runs can be highly efficient.

## Drayage Insurance Considerations

Port drayage at Savannah creates specific insurance exposure. Containers moving between the terminal and inland distribution points face congestion risk on GA-21 and I-16, cargo liability for high-value imports, and the general hazards of operating heavy equipment in a busy port environment.

RMS recommends the following minimum coverage for [Savannah drayage operations](/coverage/cargo/):
- $1,000,000 auto liability
- Cargo insurance matching your highest container value
- Non-trucking liability for bobtail movements
- Factor in TWIC card costs as an operating expense

The Port of Savannah connects to [Florida ports](/states/trucking-insurance-florida/) via I-95 South and to the [Port of Charleston](/states/trucking-insurance-south-carolina/charleston-port/) via I-95 North. Carriers working multiple Southeast ports should ensure their coverage accounts for the full geographic range.
