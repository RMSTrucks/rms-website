## NDOT Permit System

Nebraska Department of Transportation handles all oversize/overweight permits through their online system. The process is straightforward, and Nebraska offers some of the most generous single-trip permit durations in the region.

## Permit Types

| Permit Type | Duration | Key Details |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Single-trip | 10 days | Most generous in the region (vs 5-day standard) |
| Annual oversize | 12 months | For repeated oversize loads |
| Annual overweight | 12 months | For repeated overweight loads |
| Emergency | Case by case | For urgent shipments requiring immediate movement |

### The 10-Day Single-Trip Advantage

Nebraska's 10-day single-trip permit is notably generous compared to neighboring states:

| State | Single-Trip Duration |
|-------|---------------------|
| Nebraska | 10 days |
| Kansas | 24 or 72 hours |
| Iowa | 5 days |
| Wyoming | 5 days |
| Colorado | 5 days |

That 10-day window gives substantial flexibility for loads that might face delays due to weather, equipment issues, or scheduling changes. It is particularly valuable in winter when I-80 closures can eat multiple days of travel time.

## Weight Limits

### Standard Limits

| Axle Configuration | Nebraska Limit | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-------|
| Single axle | 20,000 lb | Standard |
| Tandem axle | 34,000 lb | Standard |
| Tridem axle | 42,000 lb | **Lower than OH (48K) and KS (48K)** |
| Gross vehicle weight | 80,000 lb | Standard |

### Permitted Overweight Limits

| Route Type | Maximum Permitted Weight |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Interstate | 95,000 lb |
| State highways | Varies by bridge ratings |
| County roads | Requires county approval |

The 95,000 lb interstate maximum is generous for permitted loads. Bridge ratings on state highways may restrict weights further -- the permit system routes around weight-limited bridges automatically.

### Tridem Note

Nebraska's 42,000 lb tridem limit is lower than neighboring Kansas and Ohio (both 48,000 lb). If you are running a tridem configuration at 48,000 lb in Kansas and crossing into Nebraska, you exceed the legal limit and need a permit. This catches carriers who assume uniform Midwest weight standards.

## Dimensional Limits

| Dimension | Nebraska Standard |
|-----------|------------------|
| Height | 13.5 ft |
| Width | 8.5 ft |
| Single trailer | 53 ft |
| GVW | 80,000 lb |

Nebraska's dimensional limits are standard for the region. Kansas has more generous height (14 ft) and trailer length (59.5 ft) limits, so loads legal in Kansas may need permits in Nebraska.

## The 25 MPH Wind Restriction

**Overdimensional loads are prohibited when winds exceed 25 mph.** This is the single most important permit restriction in Nebraska.

| Load Type | Wind Restriction |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Overdimensional (any oversize dimension) | Prohibited above 25 mph winds |
| Overweight only (legal dimensions) | No wind restriction |

### What This Means Practically

Nebraska experiences sustained winds above 25 mph frequently, especially:

- Western Nebraska (I-80 from North Platte to Wyoming): high wind events are common November through April
- Open prairie sections statewide: no terrain windbreaks
- Spring wind season (March-May): gusts can exceed 50 mph

For oversize haulers, this wind restriction can shut down operations for days at a time. Plan schedules with weather contingency built in. A 10-day permit helps absorb weather delays that would expire a 5-day permit.

### Checking Wind Conditions

- **511.nebraska.gov:** Real-time wind data by corridor
- **National Weather Service:** Wind forecasts and advisories
- **NDOT permit office:** Can provide guidance on current conditions

## Emergency Permits

Nebraska offers emergency permits for urgent shipments that cannot wait for standard processing:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Availability | Case by case |
| Purpose | Urgent shipments requiring immediate movement |
| Process | Contact NDOT directly |
| Restrictions | Same wind and weather restrictions apply |

Emergency permits do not waive the 25 mph wind restriction. Even urgent loads must stop when winds are too high for overdimensional travel.

## Route Restrictions

NDOT permit routes account for:

- Bridge weight and clearance ratings
- Construction zones that may block oversize passage
- Road surface conditions (especially relevant during spring thaw)
- Wind exposure areas (though this is advisory, not route-restricted)

Route deviation is a violation. If your permitted route is blocked, contact NDOT for a route amendment before taking an alternate path.

## Agricultural Oversize

Nebraska's agricultural economy generates oversize loads including:

- Farm equipment moves (combines, headers, planters)
- Wind energy components (tower sections, blades, nacelles)
- Hay bale loads exceeding standard height

Agricultural equipment moves are common on Nebraska highways, especially during planting (March-May) and harvest (September-November) seasons. These moves require oversize permits when dimensions exceed standard limits.

## Comparison with Neighboring States

| Feature | NE | KS | IA | WY |
|---------|----|----|----|----|
| Single-trip duration | 10 days | 24-72 hrs | 5 days | 5 days |
| Interstate max weight | 95,000 lb | 80,000 lb | 80,000 lb | Varies |
| Wind restriction | 25 mph | None formal | None | Varies |
| Tridem limit | 42,000 lb | 48,000 lb | N/A | Varies |
| Height standard | 13.5 ft | 14 ft | 13.5 ft | 14 ft |

Nebraska's generous permit duration and interstate weight maximum are advantages. The wind restriction and lower tridem limit are the trade-offs.
