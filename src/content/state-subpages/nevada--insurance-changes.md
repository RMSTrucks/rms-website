## What SB 180 Does

Senate Bill 180, passed in 2025, doubles the minimum liability insurance requirement for intrastate commercial carriers in Nevada. The increase is phased over four years, moving from $750,000 to $1,500,000 by 2030.

This is the most significant change to Nevada trucking insurance requirements in decades. Every intrastate carrier operating vehicles over 26,001 lbs must comply.

## The Phase Timeline

| Effective Date | Minimum Liability | Increase from Current |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Before Jan 2026 | $750,000 | Baseline |
| January 1, 2026 | $1,000,000 | +$250,000 (33% increase) |
| January 1, 2028 | $1,250,000 | +$500,000 (67% increase) |
| January 1, 2030 | $1,500,000 | +$750,000 (100% increase) |

## Who Is Affected

| Carrier Type | Affected? | Details |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Intrastate carriers (26,001+ lbs) | Yes | Must comply with each phase deadline |
| Interstate carriers | No | Federal $750K minimum applies; no state override |
| Intrastate carriers (under 26,001 lbs) | No | Different minimums apply |
| Passenger carriers | Separate | Nevada Transportation Authority regulates separately |

The critical distinction: **interstate** carriers operating through Nevada on federal authority continue under the $750,000 federal minimum. SB 180 targets carriers operating **within** Nevada on state authority.

## What This Means for Your Premiums

Higher liability limits mean higher premiums. The relationship is not linear -- doubling your limit does not double your premium -- but the increases are significant.

### Estimated Premium Impact

The actual premium increase depends on your specific risk profile: driving record, vehicle type, cargo, territory, and years of experience. As a general framework:

| Phase | Limit Increase | Estimated Premium Impact |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| $750K to $1M | +33% liability | 15-25% premium increase |
| $1M to $1.25M | +25% liability | 10-15% additional increase |
| $1.25M to $1.5M | +20% liability | 8-12% additional increase |
| Total ($750K to $1.5M) | +100% liability | 35-55% total premium increase |

These are estimates. Your actual increase will vary. The key takeaway: budget for significantly higher insurance costs through 2030.

## How Nevada Compares

| State | Intrastate Minimum | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Nevada (current) | $750,000 | Baseline before SB 180 |
| Nevada (by 2030) | $1,500,000 | SB 180 final phase |
| Federal (interstate) | $750,000 | General freight |
| [Idaho](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/) | $750,000 | Federal minimum |
| [Oregon](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/) | $750,000 | Federal minimum |
| [Arizona](/states/trucking-insurance-arizona/) | $750,000 | Federal minimum |
| [Washington](/states/trucking-insurance-washington/) | $750,000 | Federal minimum for interstate |

By 2030, Nevada intrastate carriers will carry twice the liability insurance of carriers in neighboring states. This makes Nevada one of the most expensive states for intrastate trucking insurance.

## Action Steps for Carriers

### If You Are Currently at $750,000

You need to increase to $1,000,000 by January 1, 2026. Do not wait until December 2025. Insurance carriers need processing time, and there may be underwriting reviews at the higher limit. Start the process now.

### If You Are Already at $1,000,000

You are compliant through January 2028. Use the time to budget for the next increase. Consider locking in favorable rates before the January 2028 deadline drives demand.

### If You Are Starting a New Carrier

Factor the full $1.5M target into your business plan. Starting at $750K today but needing $1.5M by 2030 means your insurance costs will grow substantially. Build that growth into your per-mile calculations from day one.

## Interstate vs. Intrastate: A Strategic Question

SB 180 creates a cost incentive to operate under interstate authority rather than intrastate. Interstate carriers continue at the federal $750,000 minimum. If your operations cross state lines -- even occasionally -- federal authority may be more cost-effective than Nevada intrastate authority.

This is worth discussing with your insurance agent. The authority structure affects your premium directly.

## Federal Minimums for Reference

| Cargo Type | Federal Minimum |
|-----------|----------------|
| General freight | $750,000 |
| Oil and petroleum | $1,000,000 |
| Hazardous materials | $5,000,000 |

Note that the federal hazmat minimum at $5M already exceeds SB 180 targets. Hazmat carriers in Nevada are unaffected by this change.

## Get Ahead of the Deadline

Nevada insurance minimums are doubling. Carriers who wait until the deadline to shop for higher limits will face rush pricing and limited carrier options. Start early, compare quotes, and lock in rates before each phase deadline.
