## The Four-Agency Split

Washington splits trucking regulatory authority across four agencies.

| Agency | Handles | Contact |
|--------|---------|----------|
| WSDOT | Permits, road conditions, OSOW | wsdot.wa.gov |
| WSP | Enforcement, inspections, CVE | wsp.wa.gov |
| UTC | Intrastate for-hire authority, insurance | utc.wa.gov |
| DOL | Vehicle registration, CDL | dol.wa.gov |

## eSNOOPI Pro: Self-Service Permits

85% of all oversize/overweight permits are self-issued online through eSNOOPI Pro. In 2023, 183,502 permits were issued.

| Permit Type | Fee Range | Processing |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Single Trip | ~$10-30 | Self-issue, immediate |
| Annual | ~$100-300+ | 5-10 days |

Only for non-divisible loads. Divisible loads cannot be permitted overweight.

## 60 MPH Statewide Truck Speed Limit

ALL vehicles over 10,000 lbs GVW: **60 mph maximum statewide**. No rural exceptions. No highway-by-highway variance. This is one of the lowest truck speed limits in the West.

## UTC Intrastate Requirements

- Obtain UTC permit or certificate
- File proof of insurance with UTC
- Display both UTC AND USDOT numbers on both sides of vehicle
- Under 10,000 lbs: $300,000 CSL minimum
- Over 10,000 lbs: $750,000 CSL minimum

## Electronic Screening

In 2023, electronic screening saved the industry 280,000 hours and $36.9 million. Clean carriers get automatic bypass. Interoperable with PrePass and Drivewyze.
