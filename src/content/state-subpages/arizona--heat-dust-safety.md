## Pull Aside Stay Alive: Dust Storm Protocol

Arizona dust storms (haboobs) can reduce visibility to zero in seconds. The "Pull Aside Stay Alive" protocol is the official response:

1. **Immediately reduce speed** and check traffic around you
2. **Exit the highway** if you safely can
3. **Pull completely off the paved roadway** -- onto dirt or gravel shoulder
4. **Turn OFF ALL LIGHTS** -- headlights, tail lights, hazards, everything
5. **Set your parking brake**
6. **Keep your seatbelt on** and foot OFF the brake pedal (no brake lights)
7. **Wait for the storm to pass**

**Why turn off lights?** Other drivers follow tail lights in zero visibility. If your lights are on, someone will steer directly into you. This instruction is counterintuitive and critical.

## I-10 Dust Detection System

The Eloy-to-Picacho Peak corridor on I-10 between Phoenix and Tucson was the first in America to deploy automated dust detection:

- **13 visibility sensors** along the corridor
- Variable speed limit system reduces speed from **75 to 35 mph** when triggered
- Automated alerts broadcast on highway advisory radio
- Active during monsoon season: **late June through early September**

## Extreme Heat Safety

Southern Arizona pavement temperatures exceed **150 degrees F** in summer. This affects your equipment and your survival.

### Tire Safety

- **Check tire pressure BEFORE heat** -- morning inspections only. Hot tires read higher pressure.
- Underinflated tires on 150-degree pavement have dramatically increased blowout risk
- Carry a tire pressure gauge and use it daily during summer months

### Desert Breakdown Survival

- Keep fuel tank at **3/4 minimum** -- desert breakdowns are life-threatening
- Carry **minimum 1 gallon water per person**
- **Heat exhaustion begins within 15 minutes** at 115+ degrees
- **Stay with your vehicle** if broken down -- it provides shade and is visible to rescuers
- Cell coverage is unreliable in remote southern Arizona desert

## Monthly Temperature Reference

| Month | Phoenix Avg High | Tucson Avg High | Flagstaff Avg High |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| June | 104 F | 100 F | 78 F |
| July | 106 F | 100 F | 81 F |
| August | 104 F | 98 F | 79 F |
| September | 100 F | 95 F | 73 F |

## Insurance Implications

I-10 dust storm pileups generate multi-vehicle claims. A single haboob-caused chain reaction crash can total a dozen vehicles. Heat-related equipment failures (tire blowouts, brake fade) are predictable and preventable -- but if they happen, the claims are severe. $1M CSL minimum recommended for Arizona operations.
