## Chain Requirements

Nevada does not have a fixed chain carry season like [Idaho](/states/trucking-insurance-idaho/chain-laws/) or [Oregon](/states/trucking-insurance-oregon/chain-laws/). Instead, chain requirements are triggered by actual conditions and posted on signs, advisory radio, and NVRoads.com.

### Who Must Chain

| Vehicle Type | Requirement |
|-------------|------------|
| Commercial vehicles over 10,000 lbs | Chains on at least two driving wheels when posted |
| Vehicles pulling trailers with brakes | Chains also required on braking wheels of trailer |
| All vehicles | Must comply with posted chain requirements |

### Key Chain Areas

| Area | Route | Elevation | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Sierra Nevada | I-80 (Reno to CA border) | 5,000-7,000 ft | Primary chain zone, frequent winter closures |
| Carson City to Tahoe | US-50 | 5,000-7,000 ft | Mountain pass, heavy snow |
| Spring Mountain | US-95/SR-160 | 5,000+ ft | Southern Nevada, less frequent |

## I-80 Sierra Nevada: The Primary Chain Zone

The stretch of I-80 from Reno west to the California border climbs through the Sierra Nevada and is the most frequently chained corridor in Nevada. This is a continuation of the same mountain pass that requires chain controls on the California side -- the Donner Pass corridor.

Winter storms can close I-80 at the California border for hours or days. When the road is open but conditions are marginal, chain requirements are posted. The chain-up areas are on the approach to the summit in both directions.

### What Makes This Different from Idaho or Oregon

| Factor | Nevada | Idaho | Oregon |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Fixed carry season | No | Oct 1 - Apr 30 | Nov 1 - Apr 1 |
| Triggered by | Posted conditions | Posted conditions + carry law | Posted conditions + carry law |
| Primary chain corridor | I-80 Sierra Nevada | I-90 Lookout/Fourth of July | I-84 Cabbage Hill |
| Elevation concern | 5,000-7,000 ft | 4,725 ft (Lookout) | 4,193 ft (Cabbage Hill) |

The absence of a fixed carry season means you must check conditions before every winter trip. NVRoads.com and 511 Nevada provide real-time chain requirement status.

## Washoe Valley Wind Restriction

This is the regulation that catches drivers by surprise. Between Reno and Carson City, Washoe Valley on US-395/I-580 is subject to extreme crosswinds that have tipped semi-trucks.

### The Rule

| Detail | Specification |
|--------|-------------|
| Vehicles affected | High-profile vehicles 9+ feet tall |
| Includes | Semi-trucks, box trucks, RVs, vehicles with trailers |
| Trigger | High wind conditions as determined by NDOT |
| Enforcement | Actively enforced by NHP |
| Duration | Until wind conditions subside |

### How You Will Know

- Electronic message signs on US-395/I-580 approaching Washoe Valley
- Highway advisory radio
- 511 Nevada (phone and web)
- NVRoads.com real-time alerts

### What to Do When Restricted

There is no alternate route that avoids Washoe Valley between Reno and Carson City for commercial trucks. When the restriction is active, you wait. Park in Reno or Carson City and monitor conditions. The restriction typically lifts within hours, but during extended wind events it can last a full day or more.

## I-80 Wind Hazards

Beyond Washoe Valley, wind is a factor on I-80 in the open desert segments. The Humboldt corridor between Lovelock and Winnemucca and the eastern segments between Elko and Wendover experience crosswinds that can push high-profile vehicles. These are not regulated with restrictions like Washoe Valley, but they are real hazards that contribute to rollover incidents.

Compare this to [Wyoming I-80](/states/trucking-insurance-wyoming/i80-wind-closures/), where wind closures are more formalized and frequent.

## Real-Time Condition Resources

| Resource | Access |
|----------|--------|
| NVRoads.com | Real-time road conditions, chain requirements, closures |
| 511 Nevada | Phone: 511 (in-state) or (877) 687-6237 |
| NDOT Road Conditions | nvroads.com or NVRoads mobile app |
| California Chain Control | For I-80 continuity west of the border |

## Insurance Implications

Wind-related rollovers and winter chain-zone accidents generate high-severity claims. The Washoe Valley corridor specifically has a history of truck tipping incidents. Carriers running the Reno-Carson City route should carry physical damage coverage and maintain $1M CSL minimum. Under [SB 180](/states/trucking-insurance-nevada/insurance-changes/), intrastate minimums are increasing. Contact RMS at (208) 800-0640 for Nevada coverage.
