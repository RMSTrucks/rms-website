## Tennessee Weigh Station Master Table

Tennessee operates 22 weigh stations, with 14 on I-40 alone -- the highest concentration of any interstate in the state. PrePass and Drivewyze are both active and highly valuable given the station density.

| Interstate | Location | Mile Marker | Direction | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| I-40 | Memphis area | MM 12 | EB/WB | Near AR border |
| I-40 | Jackson | MM 49-50 | EB/WB | -- |
| I-40 | Bucksnort | MM 137 | EB/WB | -- |
| I-40 | Lebanon | MM 226-228 | EB/WB | Near Nashville |

## I-40: Memphis to North Carolina (455 Miles)

The backbone of Tennessee freight. I-40 runs the entire width of the state and carries the heaviest truck traffic in the Southeast corridor system.

### Segment-by-Segment

**MM 0-25 (Memphis):** FedEx World Hub proximity drives massive distribution traffic. See the [Memphis hub guide](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/memphis-hub/) for routing details. I-40/I-55 interchange.

**MM 25-137 (West Tennessee Flats):** Relatively flat terrain through Jackson and rural West Tennessee. Jackson weigh station at MM 49-50. Good truck stop infrastructure along this stretch.

**MM 137-200 (Nashville Approach):** Traffic increases steadily approaching Nashville. Bucksnort weigh station at MM 137.

**MM 200-230 (Nashville):** I-40, I-65, and I-24 converge. Major congestion 6 AM to 9 AM and 3 PM to 7 PM. The I-440 bypass south of downtown can save time for through-traffic, but it also carries heavy volume.

**MM 230-307 (Cumberland Plateau):** Gradual elevation changes. Fog and ice possible November through March. Monterey weigh station at MM 307. Cell coverage gaps in rural areas.

**MM 307-430 (Knoxville):** I-40/I-75 merge for 17 miles through Knoxville. Heavy traffic at the merge. Weigh station at MM 372.

**MM 430-451 (Smokies):** Dangerous mountain grades. See the [mountain driving guide](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/mountain-grades/) for detailed safety procedures. Hartford weigh station at MM 441 is the last station before the [North Carolina border](/states/trucking-insurance-north-carolina/corridors/).

## I-24: Nashville to Chattanooga (180 Miles)

### Monteagle Mountain Warning

I-24 between MM 134 and MM 155 crosses Monteagle Mountain at a sustained 6% grade. This is one of the most dangerous truck grades in the eastern US. Full details in the [mountain driving guide](/states/trucking-insurance-tennessee/mountain-grades/).

Manchester weigh station at MM 115 is the last inspection point before the mountain. Brake inspections are prioritized at this location.

## I-65: Kentucky to Alabama (121 Miles)

Nashville is the primary feature on this corridor. I-65 runs through downtown Nashville and carries heavy commuter and freight traffic. The [Kentucky corridor guide](/states/trucking-insurance-kentucky/corridors/) covers I-65 north of the state line.

Mitchellville weigh station near the Kentucky border serves northbound and southbound traffic.

## I-75: Kentucky to Georgia (162 Miles)

I-75 enters Tennessee from the [Georgia border](/states/trucking-insurance-georgia/corridors/) near Cleveland and runs north through Knoxville to the Kentucky line. The Cleveland weigh station at MM 13-23.5 is the primary checkpoint near Georgia.

The I-40/I-75 merge through Knoxville (17 miles) is one of the heaviest truck traffic segments in Tennessee. This stretch connects directly to the Smoky Mountain crossing on I-40 East.

## TDOT HELP Program

Tennessee DOT operates the HELP truck -- free roadside assistance for disabled vehicles on designated interstate segments. The program covers tire changes, jump starts, fuel delivery, and minor mechanical assistance. No charge to the motorist. Coverage includes segments of I-40, I-65, I-24, and I-75 in the Nashville and Knoxville metro areas.
