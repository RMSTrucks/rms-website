Here's the deal with I-90: this is the long haul. Three thousand miles from the shores of Lake Erie to the mountains of Montana, and a good chunk of it is wide open nothing. You'll pay some of the highest truck tolls in the country getting through Chicago, cross the entire Great Plains where the next town is a speck on the horizon, and end up in country where deer and elk are more common than other trucks. This corridor tests your patience, your planning, and your ability to be alone with your thoughts for hours at a stretch.

I-90 is the longest interstate in the system. Freight tends to be agricultural, manufactured goods from the Midwest, and energy sector loads from the Dakotas and Montana. The loads pay well because not everybody wants to run 400 miles of South Dakota prairie in January.

## Ohio -- 244 Miles

I-90 enters Ohio as the Ohio Turnpike, and you'll be paying tolls for most of your time in the state. The turnpike runs along the Lake Erie shoreline through Cleveland and west toward Indiana. Cleveland is the major metro -- the I-90/I-77 and I-90/I-71 interchanges handle significant traffic, and the lakefront section can back up during rush hours.

The Ohio Turnpike is well-maintained and moves efficiently. E-ZPass works here, and the toll discount for transponder-equipped vehicles is significant compared to paying cash. If you're running this corridor regularly, the transponder pays for itself in a week.

Cleveland's weather is Lake Effect driven. Snow squalls materialize out of clear skies and drop visibility to near zero in seconds. They're intense but usually localized -- you might drive through a mile of blizzard conditions and come out the other side to dry pavement.

## Indiana -- 156 Miles

Indiana's section of I-90 is the Indiana Toll Road, running from the Ohio line through South Bend to the Illinois border. The toll road was leased to a private operator, and the tolls reflect that -- they've gone up steadily. South Bend is the main city, and Notre Dame means heavy traffic on football weekends. Don't try to pass through on a Saturday when the Irish are playing at home.

The road is flat, straight, northern Indiana farmland. The road surface can be rough from freeze-thaw cycles. Fuel at captive service plazas runs higher than off-interstate options -- plan your stops accordingly.

## Illinois -- 103 Miles

Illinois is only 103 miles on I-90, but it might be the most expensive 103 miles you'll ever drive. The Chicago Skyway carries some of the highest truck tolls in the country -- a five-axle truck pays over $30 one way on the Skyway alone, and tolls on the connecting Illinois Tollway system add up fast.

Chicago is controlled chaos. The interchange where I-90 meets I-94, I-290, and the Dan Ryan tests every skill you have as a driver. Lane changes happen fast, space is tight, and other drivers are aggressive. The window between 10 PM and 5 AM is your best shot at moving through at highway speed. Daytime rush hours can add two or three hours to your trip.

The I-90/I-94 corridor is under nearly perpetual construction. Pay attention to overhead signs and don't rely on autopilot through this stretch.

## Wisconsin -- 187 Miles

Wisconsin is where you start to breathe again after Chicago. The terrain rolls gently through dairy country from the Illinois border through Madison to La Crosse on the Mississippi River. Dairy products, cheese, beer, and processed food move out of Wisconsin constantly.

The I-90/I-94 split east of Madison requires attention -- make sure you follow I-90 toward La Crosse and not I-94 toward Minneapolis. It's an easy mistake that costs an hour and a half of backtracking. The stretch from Madison to La Crosse runs through the Driftless Area, the unglaciated hill country of western Wisconsin with bluffs and river valleys. After 700 miles of turnpike and tollway, you'll appreciate the change.

Wisconsin winters are cold and snowy, but the state does an excellent job of snow removal on I-90.

## Minnesota -- 275 Miles

Minnesota's I-90 runs along the southern border of the state from La Crosse through Rochester and Albert Lea to the South Dakota line. This isn't the Twin Cities -- this is rural southern Minnesota. Rochester is the biggest city, home to the Mayo Clinic, but it's not a significant trucking bottleneck.

The critical thing to know is the spring weight restrictions. From mid-March to mid-May, Minnesota reduces allowable axle weights on most roads to protect thawing pavement. Any pickup or delivery that takes you off the interstate onto state highways will hit these restrictions. Plan your loads accordingly or eat the fines.

The western half is pure prairie. Crosswinds push empty trailers around, and winter blizzards can close the road entirely. Minnesota DOT will close I-90 segments when conditions become too dangerous. Take the closures seriously.

## South Dakota -- 412 Miles

Here's where the corridor gets real. Once you pass Sioux Falls heading west, there's about 350 miles of open prairie with very little in between. Mitchell and Chamberlain are the only towns of any size until Rapid City.

This stretch tests your planning. Fuel stops are spaced out, services are limited, and cell coverage can be spotty in the western half. If you break down between Chamberlain and Rapid City, you might wait a long time for a service truck. Carry water, food, and basic tools.

Wind is the constant companion. Sustained winds of 25-35 mph are normal, and gusts over 50 mph happen regularly. Empty trailers get blown over. Winter is brutal -- temperatures of minus 20 are common, blizzards close the interstate multiple times each winter, and ground blizzards create whiteout conditions at road level while the sky above is clear. That's a South Dakota specialty.

## Wyoming -- 207 Miles

Wyoming is the transition from plains to mountains. You pass through Sheridan and Buffalo and start climbing toward the Bighorn Mountains. The terrain becomes rugged, and the grades become real. Gear down for descents and don't overcook your brakes.

Wyoming wind is legendary -- the state may be the windiest in the lower 48. Wind gates and closures for high-profile vehicles are common, especially in winter. Wyoming DOT doesn't hesitate to close roads. Fuel and services are available in Sheridan and Buffalo, but between towns, you're on your own.

## Montana -- 548 Miles

Montana is the grand finale -- 548 miles across some of the most beautiful and isolated country in America. Speed limits are higher here (80 mph for trucks on the interstate), and the distances between services can be long.

The biggest hazard is wildlife. Deer, elk, and moose are a year-round threat, especially dangerous at dawn and dusk. A collision with a 1,200-pound bull elk at highway speed will end your trip and possibly your career. The road cuts through migration corridors, and animals cross without warning.

Billings is the largest city and serves as a regional freight hub. West of Billings, the road climbs through mountain passes and river valleys. Montana winters are mountain winters -- snow, ice, wind, and cold that makes South Dakota look mild. Carry chains, winter gear, and emergency supplies.

This corridor rewards the prepared and punishes the careless. Plan your fuel, plan your rest, plan your weather windows, and respect the isolation. The loads pay well out here because the corridor demands competence.
