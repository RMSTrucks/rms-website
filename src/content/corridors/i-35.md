Here's the deal with I-35: this is the spine of NAFTA freight. Everything moving between Mexico and the Upper Midwest rides this road. You start at the border in Laredo where the trucks are stacked up 24/7, and you don't stop until you hit Minneapolis 1,568 miles later. Along the way you'll cross tornado alley, navigate some of the ugliest interchanges in the country, and watch the temperature drop 60 degrees between your starting point and your destination.

This corridor is money. Produce, auto parts, electronics, consumer goods -- it all flows north from the border and manufactured goods flow south. If you're running I-35 regular, you're in the thick of American commerce. But the route demands respect. Weather kills people on this road every year, the border crossings will eat your schedule if you don't plan, and the northern states will ground you in winter if your equipment isn't right.

## Texas -- 504 Miles

Texas owns the biggest chunk of I-35, and it starts with the most important truck crossing in the Western Hemisphere. Laredo processes more international truck freight than any other port of entry in the Americas. If you're pulling loads out of Mexico, you already know about the wait times, the customs inspections, and the broker coordination that has to happen before you even hit US pavement. Budget extra time. Always.

Once you clear Laredo, you're running north through San Antonio, Austin, and up to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. San Antonio to Austin is one of the most congested stretches on the entire corridor -- Texas has been building and rebuilding this section for what feels like forever. The I-35/I-10 interchange in San Antonio is a known bottleneck. Try to hit it outside of rush hour or you'll be sitting.

Austin is its own kind of headache. The city has exploded in population and the infrastructure hasn't kept up. Through downtown Austin, I-35 narrows and the on/off ramps are tight. There's been a major reconstruction project that's improved things, but expect lane shifts and reduced speeds.

North of Austin through Waco to Dallas-Fort Worth, the road opens up some. DFW is a major distribution hub, so expect heavy truck traffic around the interchanges. The I-35E and I-35W split through Dallas and Fort Worth can confuse first-timers -- know which one you need before you get there.

Texas summers mean heat. Check your tires, watch your coolant, and stay hydrated. Blowouts spike when pavement temperatures hit 130-plus degrees.

## Oklahoma -- 235 Miles

You cross into Oklahoma and almost immediately hit toll roads. The Turner Turnpike and other toll facilities are part of life here. Make sure your toll transponder is set up or you'll be dealing with violations. Oklahoma doesn't play around with unpaid tolls on commercial vehicles.

Oklahoma City is the major pinch point. The I-35/I-40 interchange downtown has been rebuilt but it still gets congested during peak hours. If you're passing through, early morning or late evening is your friend.

The real threat in Oklahoma is weather. This is the heart of tornado alley. From March through June, severe thunderstorms can drop tornadoes with very little warning. Keep your weather radio on and have a plan. When the sky turns green and the wind stops, find a solid structure. Don't try to outrun a tornado in a loaded rig. High-profile trailers are also vulnerable to straight-line winds during storms -- 60 mph gusts will put an empty van on its side.

The Oklahoma DOT maintains variable message signs on I-35 that post weather alerts. Pay attention to them. They're not suggestions.

## Kansas -- 236 Miles

Kansas means the Kansas Turnpike. You'll be on it from the Oklahoma border up through Wichita and beyond. Tolls are a cost of doing business here. The turnpike is generally well-maintained and moves well, but Wichita can get tight during commute hours.

The Wichita interchange where I-35 meets the turnpike and connects to I-135 and US-54 requires attention. Multiple ramps, lane changes, and merging traffic all in a short stretch. Study it on a map before you run it the first time.

Kansas weather is its own animal. Wind is constant on the plains. Crosswinds of 30-40 mph are not unusual, and empty trailers get pushed around. Winter brings ice storms that coat the road in a sheet of black ice with no warning. Kansas DOT will close the turnpike when conditions get bad enough, but the rural stretches of I-35 north and south of the turnpike might not get that treatment as fast. Carry chains even if you think you won't need them.

Fuel up when you can. While the turnpike has service plazas, the spacing between fuel stops off the interstate can surprise you.

## Missouri -- 115 Miles

Missouri is the shortest state segment on I-35, but Kansas City makes it memorable. The KC metro area is where I-35 meets I-70, I-29, and I-435, and the interchange complexity is legendary. Multiple levels, tight ramps, lane drops, and heavy traffic from every direction.

Kansas City straddles the state line, so you're dealing with both Kansas and Missouri regulations in a short stretch. The downtown loop interchanges have been rebuilt in recent years but remain challenging for trucks. GPS sometimes routes you onto roads with low clearances or weight restrictions in the urban core -- trust your truck GPS, not a car app.

If you're passing through KC, the I-435 bypass loop can save you from the worst downtown congestion, but it adds miles. Weigh the tradeoff based on time of day. Rush hour through downtown KC is not where you want to be with a 53-footer.

Missouri also requires an intrastate fuel tax registration for commercial vehicles. Make sure your IFTA credentials are current.

## Iowa -- 218 Miles

Iowa is farm country and it looks simple on a map, but this stretch of I-35 has its own personality. Des Moines is the major metro area, and it seems like there's always construction somewhere in the Des Moines interchange system. I-35 meets I-80 here, and that junction carries enormous traffic volumes.

The road surface in Iowa takes a beating from freeze-thaw cycles. Frost heaves -- those sudden bumps and dips in the pavement -- are worst in late winter and early spring. They'll rattle your teeth and beat up your cargo if you're not expecting them. Slow down when the road surface starts looking rough.

Iowa winters are serious. Snow, ice, and sub-zero temperatures are standard from December through March. Iowa DOT does a good job with snow removal on I-35, but rural stretches can drift over fast in a blizzard. Whiteout conditions happen. If visibility drops below a quarter mile, find a safe place to stop. Pileups on I-35 in Iowa have made national news more than once.

Rest areas and fuel stops are adequate but spread out north and south of Des Moines. Plan your stops.

## Minnesota -- 260 Miles

The final 260 miles bring you into Minnesota and the Twin Cities -- Minneapolis-St. Paul. This is where the corridor ends and your cargo disperses into the Upper Midwest distribution network.

The biggest thing to know about Minnesota is the frost law, also called spring weight restrictions. From roughly mid-March through mid-May, Minnesota restricts axle weights on most roads to protect thawing pavement. This hits hard if you're running loaded. You need to plan around it or face fines. The restrictions vary by road classification, so check MnDOT's spring load restriction map before you dispatch.

The Twin Cities metro is congested, especially during rush hours. I-35 splits into I-35E and I-35W through the metro area. I-35E through St. Paul has truck restrictions on a segment near downtown -- trucks over a certain weight are prohibited. Know which split you need and plan accordingly.

Winter in Minnesota is the real deal. Temperatures of minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit are normal in January. Your fuel will gel if you're not running winter blend diesel and treating it properly. Anti-gel additive is not optional. Engine block heaters, winter-weight oil, and fully charged batteries are baseline requirements. Minnesota law requires you to clear snow and ice from the top of your trailer before driving -- they enforce it and the fines are real.

The Twin Cities have solid truck services and plenty of freight to reload. This is a major logistics hub with distribution centers for Target, Best Buy, and dozens of other major shippers. Finding a backhaul shouldn't be a problem.

Running the full I-35 corridor means planning for every season, every climate zone, and every regulatory quirk between the Mexican border and the Canadian prairie. Respect the distance, respect the weather, and keep your paperwork tight. This road pays well because it demands a lot.
