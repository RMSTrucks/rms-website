        <div class="value-col">
          <h3>We Know Your Business First</h3>

        <p class="section-intro">We specialize in commercial trucking insurance for owner-operators and small fleets. Every coverage we offer, we can explain in plain English. If we can't explain why you need it, you probably don't.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="coverage-card">
          <div class="coverage-badge required">Required by FMCSA</div>
          <h3>Auto Liability</h3>
          <p>The coverage that keeps you legal. Protects you when you're at fault in an accident. Federal law requires $750,000 minimum for interstate carriers—some brokers and shippers require $1 million. We'll help you understand what limits you actually need.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>It depends—and anyone who quotes you a price without asking questions is guessing. Your rate depends on your experience, your equipment, what you haul, where you operate, and your safety record. For a new authority with a newer truck, expect $12,000-$18,000/year for basic coverage. Experienced operators with clean records pay less. We'll give you a real quote based on your actual situation.</p>

              <p>Honest answer: probably not much different. We all use the same carriers for new authorities—the price is basically the same everywhere. The difference is who picks up when you call, and whether they actually know the answer. We compete on service and expertise, not on being the cheapest.</p>

              <p>Your DOT number is your safety registration with FMCSA—every commercial vehicle over 10,001 lbs needs one. Your MC (Motor Carrier) number is your operating authority—required if you're hauling freight for hire across state lines. You need both to operate legally as an interstate motor carrier.</p>

          <h2>Why RMS Exists</h2>

          <p class="about-lead">RMS Insurance was founded on a simple frustration: truckers deserve better.</p>

          <p>Trucking insurance isn't complicated—the industry just profits from keeping you confused. Agents use jargon to sound smart. Nobody explains anything. Everyone benefits when you don't quite understand what you're buying.</p>

          <p>We started RMS because that sticks in our craw. Our founder has a law degree and deep expertise in federal trucking regulations—the complexity that takes most people months to untangle, we can see through in minutes. And we believe that expertise should work for truckers, not against them.</p>

          <p>When you call RMS, things happen. Fast and right. You get straight answers in plain English. You understand what you're buying and why. And you have an expert in your corner who's actually on your side.</p>

          <p class="about-emphasis">That's what "finally, someone on your side" means.</p>
