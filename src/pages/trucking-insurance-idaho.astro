  {
    question: "Does Idaho require chains on all highways in winter?",
    answer: "No. Idaho's chain law (Idaho Code 49-948) applies only on three specific passes: Lookout Pass (I-90), Fourth of July Pass (I-90), and Lolo Pass (Highway 12). ITD posts when chains are required - they can't mandate chains on bare pavement."
  },
  {
    question: "Are farm trucks exempt from Idaho's chain law?",
    answer: "Yes. Under Idaho Code 49-948(6), farm equipment transport and agricultural product haulers are exempt from chain requirements. So are forest product carriers, mining product carriers, and several other operation types."
  },
  {
    question: "What's Idaho's weight limit?",
    answer: "Idaho allows 105,500 lbs on state highways under Idaho Code 49-1001 - higher than the 80,000 lb federal limit. The federal limit still applies on interstates (I-84, I-90, I-15, I-86)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I don't have my medical card during an inspection?",
    answer: "As of April 1, 2025, you'll be placed Out of Service (OOS) immediately - first offense, no warnings. Carry a copy or photo of your valid medical certificate at all times. Source: Idaho State Police CVS."
  },
  {
    question: "Is RMS actually based in Idaho?",
    answer: "Yes. RMS Truck Insurance is headquartered in Idaho. When you call 208-800-0640, you're calling an Idaho office. We're not a national company with an Idaho phone number - we're local."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you insure new trucking companies with no experience?",
    answer: "Yes - that's our specialty. Most agencies avoid new authorities because they're harder to place. We've built our business on helping new owner-operators get started. Over 1,000 truckers helped through the new authority process."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can I get a certificate of insurance?",
    answer: "5 minutes or less once you're bound. When a broker needs your COI now, we deliver. Idaho freight doesn't wait, and neither do we."
  },
  {
    question: "I haul heavy loads on state highways. Do you understand Idaho's weight rules?",
    answer: "Yes. Idaho Code 49-1001 allows 105,500 lbs on state highways, with higher limits for specific commodities like logs, ores, and agricultural products. If you need overweight permits under Idaho Code 49-1004, we make sure your coverage matches your operation."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Idaho-specific insurance?",
    answer: "Federal requirements are the same regardless of your home state. You need FMCSA-compliant coverage with proper BMC-91 filing. If you're doing Idaho-only (intrastate) operations, requirements differ slightly - call us and we'll walk you through it."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get a quote?",
    answer: "Call 208-800-0640, text 208-800-0644, or fill out our online quote form. Same-day quotes for most operations. Complex risks (hazmat, specialized, 105,500 lb operations) may take 24-48 hours to shop properly."
