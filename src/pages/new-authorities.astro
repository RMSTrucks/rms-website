const faqs = [
  { question: "How much is this going to cost?", answer: "New authority insurance is expensive - typically $12,000-$20,000/year for liability alone. That's the reality. It goes down after you build history." },
  { question: "Can I get a lower price somewhere else?", answer: "Probably not. We all have access to the same 3-4 carriers that write new authorities. The rates are basically the same. The difference is service." },
  { question: "How long until I'm covered?", answer: "Once you accept a quote and pay, coverage can bind same day. Filings typically process within 24-48 hours." },
  { question: "What do I need to get a quote?", answer: "Pending MC/DOT numbers, vehicle info (year, make, model, VIN), your MVR, operating radius, and cargo types you'll haul." },
  { question: "What is the BMC-91 filing?", answer: "The BMC-91 is proof of insurance that your agent files with FMCSA. Without it, your authority can't go active. RMS files BMC-91s within 24-48 hours of binding." }

      <h2>Step-by-Step Timeline: From Application to Active Authority</h2>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-marker">Day 1</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Apply for Operating Authority</h3>
            <p>Submit your MC/DOT application through FMCSA. Cost: $300 per authority type. This starts a mandatory 21-day waiting period.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-marker">Days 1-10</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Get Your Insurance Quotes</h3>
            <p>Don't wait until day 20. Start getting insurance quotes immediately. Only 3-4 carriers even write new authorities - you're not shopping dozens of options. Get quotes early so you're ready to bind when the time comes.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-marker">Day 14-18</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Accept a Quote and Bind Coverage</h3>
            <p>Once you accept a quote and pay, your coverage can bind same day. But here's the key: your insurer must file the BMC-91 with FMCSA. RMS typically completes BMC-91 filings within 24-48 hours.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline-item">
          <div class="timeline-marker">Day 21+</div>
          <div class="timeline-content">
            <h3>Authority Goes Active</h3>
            <p>After the 21-day waiting period, assuming your BMC-91 is on file, your authority status changes from "pending" to "active." You can now legally operate.</p>
            <p class="timeline-warning"><strong>Reality check:</strong> If your BMC-91 isn't filed by day 21, your authority stays pending. Every extra day is money you're not making.</p>

            <h3>Get Your First Load</h3>
            <p>With active authority and insurance in place, you can now book loads. Brokers will request your Certificate of Insurance (COI). RMS issues COIs same-day - because waiting until tomorrow means losing the load today.</p>

  <!-- Top 5 Mistakes -->

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Top 5 Mistakes New Authorities Make</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">We've helped hundreds of new authorities get insured. These mistakes cost people time and money every week:</p>

      <div class="mistakes-grid">
        <div class="mistake-card">
          <div class="mistake-number">1</div>
          <h3>Waiting Until Day 20 to Get Insurance</h3>
          <p>Your authority has a 21-day waiting period. Some operators think, "I'll deal with insurance later." Then day 18 hits, they scramble for quotes, and their authority sits pending for an extra week.</p>
          <p class="mistake-fix"><strong>Fix:</strong> Start getting quotes on day 1. Have a policy ready to bind by day 14.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
          <div class="mistake-number">2</div>
          <h3>Underinsuring Cargo</h3>
          <p>FMCSA doesn't always require cargo insurance, but try getting loads without it. Most brokers require $100,000 minimum. Better freight requires $150,000-$250,000.</p>
          <p class="mistake-fix"><strong>Fix:</strong> Get at least $100K cargo. If you haul anything valuable, go higher.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
          <div class="mistake-number">3</div>
          <h3>Choosing the Cheapest Quote (Ignoring Service)</h3>
          <p>We all have access to the same 3-4 carriers. The rates are basically the same. A $500 difference doesn't matter when you need a certificate at 6pm Friday and your agent's office is closed.</p>
          <p class="mistake-fix"><strong>Fix:</strong> Ask: Can I get same-day COIs? What are your hours? How fast do you file the BMC-91?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
          <div class="mistake-number">4</div>
          <h3>Not Understanding Physical Damage Requirements</h3>
          <p>If you financed your truck, your lender requires physical damage coverage. Skip it, and you're in default. But if you own outright? It's optional.</p>
          <p class="mistake-fix"><strong>Fix:</strong> Check your financing agreement. Know what's required vs. optional.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mistake-card">
          <div class="mistake-number">5</div>
          <h3>Operating Before Authority Is Active</h3>
          <p>Operating with pending authority - even one load - is illegal. Get caught, and you're looking at fines, out-of-service orders, and a permanent mark on your record.</p>
          <p class="mistake-fix"><strong>Fix:</strong> Wait. Check FMCSA's SAFER system to confirm your authority is active before booking anything.</p>

      <h2>What Happens After You Get Insured</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">Getting the policy is step one. Here's what to expect in your first 90 days:</p>

      <div class="after-grid">
        <div class="after-card">
          <h3>Week 1: Get Familiar With Your Coverage</h3>
          <p>Read your policy. Know your liability limit, cargo limit, deductibles, how to file a claim, and how to request COIs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="after-card">
          <h3>Week 2-4: Set Up Your COI Process</h3>
          <p>You'll request certificates constantly. Every broker wants proof of insurance. RMS issues same-day COIs because loads don't wait.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="after-card">
          <h3>Month 2-3: Watch for Audits</h3>
          <p>Insurance carriers sometimes audit new policies. If something changed - you added a truck, hired a driver - report it proactively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="after-card">
          <h3>Month 6-12: Prepare for Renewal</h3>
          <p>With 6-12 months of clean history, you qualify for better rates. Start shopping 60 days before renewal. RMS reaches out proactively.</p>
