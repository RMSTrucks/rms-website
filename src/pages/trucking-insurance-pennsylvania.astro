        <p>If you're PA-only, you'll need a PA PUC Certificate ($100 fee for property carriers). PUC reviews in 2-3 weeks. Once approved, RMS files your Form E (liability) and Form H (cargo) with PUC directly.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> PA PUC requires your insurer to file forms directly - you can't submit your own insurance proof. RMS handles this coordination for you.</p>
        <p><strong>The RMS difference:</strong> For interstate, we time your binding perfectly. For intrastate, we coordinate Form E and Form H filings with the PUC so nothing stalls your activation.</p>
